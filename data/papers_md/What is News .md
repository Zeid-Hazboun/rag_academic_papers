Introduction
Asked how they deﬁ ne news, journalists sometimes reply: “I know it when I see it. ”
Pressed on why something has been deemed newsworthy, a typical response is:
“Because it just is!” (Brighton and Foy 2007 , 147). De ﬁnitions relying on such “gut
feeling ”(Schultz 2007 ) arguably obscure as much as they reveal about news selection,
prompting academics to offer their own explanations, which can involve devising taxo-
nomies of news values. One of the most inﬂ uential and frequently cited of these is a
paper by Johan Galtung and Mari Ruge ( 1965 ),“The Structure of Foreign News ”, published
more than 50 years ago.
Identifying and recording the news values found within published pieces of journal-
ism cannot provide a complete explanation of the journalistic process but that does not
mean such study is without value. News values are worth studying because they inform
the mediated world that is presented to news audiences, providing a shared shorthand
operational understanding of what working journalists are required to produce to dead-
lines. It is the way news values work in practice that results in them being articulated
and conveyed to new journalism trainees and journalism students, and they are also
used by public relations professionals and others aiming to obtain maximum news cover-
age of events (or pseudo-events).

O’Neill 2001 ) and Staab ( 1990 ) argued for a functional model that takes into account the
intentions of journalists. For Donsbach ( 2004 )
 news values necessarily involved subjective
judgements and can never be truly objective criteria, while Hall ( 1973 ) suggested that news
values themselves are part of an ideologically constructed way of perceiving the world that
favours and “naturalises ”the perspectives of powerful elites, a view echoed by Herman and
Chomsky ( 1988 ) in their propaganda model and McChesney ( 2000 ). Although this ideologi-
cal role of news selection (and treatments) is not the subject of either our 2001 study or the
new one, the identi ﬁcation of prevalent news values can be used to inform future research
into potential ideological impacts. Therefore, despite limitations, we argue that it remains
valuable to unpick the criteria involved in the selection of news since this “is one of the
most important areas of journalism studies[. It] goes to the heart of what is included,what is excluded, and why ”(O’Neill and Harcup 2009 , 162). Further, the journalistic selec-
tion process has been described as “probably as important or perhaps sometimes more
important than what ‘really happens ’”, when it comes to determining whether or not some-
thing becomes news (Westerhahl and Johansson 1994 , 71).
Thus, our list of news values was offered simply as one tool to aid analysis, discussion
and, we hoped, understanding of this signiﬁ cant part of the journalistic process. In this freshWHAT IS NEWS? 1471study we also set out to examine the extent to which any taxonomy of news values devised
in the age before Twitter, Facebook and other interactive platforms, can be taken as read
today. That is one of the key questions to be addressed in our revisiting news values and
attempting to update our list of selection criteria.
News Values: A Literature Review
Brighton and Foy ( 2007 , 194) draw attention to the dif ﬁculties faced by journalists
when asked to explain news: “Reiterating what has been said to both authors on countless
occasions during the research process of this book, the response to the question ‘why is this
news? ’may well remain: ‘It just is!’” However, this does not mean that journalists are com-
pletely unable to articulate why they selected one story over another:
Indeed, they [new values] pepper the daily exchanges between journalists in collaborative
production procedures …[T]hey are the terse shorthand references to shared under-
standings about the nature and purpose of news which can be used to ease the rapidand dif ﬁcult manufacture of bulletins and news programmes. (Golding and Elliott 1979 ,
114)
For their part, scholars have taken different approaches to the theorisation and study of
news values, sometimes focusing on the apparent newsworthiness of an event or news
actors to uncover why a story has been selected, but also considering the organisational,
cultural and economic factors that may also inﬂ uence news selection. Galtung and
Ruge ’s(1965 ) work was based on hypothesising selection criteria and formed part of a
wider study on how foreign events were reported in the Norwegian press. Some scholars
use their own experience and/or analysis of news outputs to conceptualise news values
(Golding and Elliott 1979 ; Harcup and O ’Neill 2001 ). Others take an overview of previous
scholarship to produce a summary of key news values (Harrison 2006 ;O’Neill and
Harcup 2009 ; Caple and Bednarek 2013 ; Harcup 2015 ), while others use ethnographic
observations and interviews (Schultz 2007 ; Dick 2014 ). Such studies are aimed at helping
us understand the judgements that are made when journalists select news, described as
“cognitive ”news values by Caple and Bednarek ( 2015 , 3).
Approaching the issue of news values from observations of Danish TV journalists,
Schultz ( 2007 ) argues that six news values dominate: timeliness, relevance, identi ﬁcation,
conﬂict, sensation and exclusivity. Being ﬁrst with a story —exclusivity —adds value for pro-
ducers who must attract audiences, and can override other news values, such as timeliness.
For Schultz, a distinction can be drawn between three types of news value: undisputed,
taken-for-granted and rarely articulated news values, which she calls doxic news values;
and explicit news values: either dominant, undisputed orthodox values, or debatable, domi-
nated (heterodox) news values (195 –196). O ’Neill ( 2012 ) suggests a hierarchy of news
values may exist, with celebrity dominating, not just in the popular press but also in
“quality ”UK newspapers.
No theory of news values can explain everything, not least because arbitrary factors
including luck, convenience and serendipity can come into play; as when a planned story
falls through at the last minute, for example, and a previously discarded one is selected to
take its place. News selection is also subject to the inﬂ uence of journalistic routines such as
issues of access and meeting deadlines (Schultz 2007 ; Phillips 2015 ); competition for exclu-
sives (Allern 2002 ; Schultz 2007 ; Phillips 2015 ); the in ﬂuence of proprietors and advertisers1472 TONY HARCUP AND DEIRDRE O ’NEILL(Caple and Bednarek 2015 ); external in ﬂuences including the role of public relations pro-
fessionals and “spin doctors ”(Brighton and Foy 2007 ); the belief systems of journalists as
a result of their social environment (Donsbach 2004 ; Phillips 2015 ); and the in ﬂuence of
peers within the workplace or “habitus ”(Bourdieu and Wacquaint 1992 , 133). Shoemaker
and Cohen ( 2006 ) found that the same newsworthiness model can be applied to news
from many countries, while Lavie and Lehman-Wilzig ( 2003 ) found little difference
between genders in the factors determining journalists ’selection of news.
News values can be seen less as a re ﬂection of what type of information citizens want
or need, and more as a re ﬂection of organisational, sociological and cultural norms com-
bined with economic factors (Weaver et al. 2007 ). This leads Allern ( 2002 ) to propose a sup-
plementary set of commercial news values, whereby sensationalist stories are most likely to
be pursued; stories that are costly to pursue are less likely to make it into the news; and
news subsidies, such as well-prepared press releases and photo opportunities, are more
likely to be taken up by resource-starved and hard-pressed journalists, and translated
into news items. This news subsidy by the public relations industry, described as pre-fabri-
cation by Bell ( 1991 ), has been observed in “quality ”media as well as less well-resourced
news organisations (Lewis, Williams, and Franklin 2008 ). Commercial pressures can also
result in the selection of news stories on the basis of their perceived appeal to target audi-ences rather than by any inherent qualities of newsworthiness or importance (Niblock and
Machin 2007 , 191; Stromback, Karlsson, and Hopmann 2012 , 726). This is particularly perti-
nent for online news. For example, an analysis of news in the ﬁve largest newspapers of the
Netherlands established that audience clicks affected news selection (Welbers et al. 2015 ), a
conclusion supported in a study of over 300 editorial gatekeepers in the United States (TienVu2014 ).
Furthermore, who is applying news values can be as important as what news values
are being applied. Using Bourdieu ’s sociological approach, Schultz ( 2007 , 197) argues that
the degree of autonomy afforded to a journalist making choices about news will depend onthe type of news organisation they work for, the type of journalism they produce, and the
level at which they operate. For Bourdieu, journalists can position themselves only within
the conﬁ nes of the social or workplace space that surrounds them (Bourdieu and Wac-
quaint 1992 ), and, as such, they hold different levels of editorial capital in the journalistic
ﬁeld (Schultz 2007 ,
194). Put simply, some journalists are in a more powerful position
than others and their decisions about what makes a story newsworthy will win out overother journalists ’decisions. In addition, the newsworthiness of some types of events or
issues is open to discussion or interpretation. For example, “hard news ”tends to comprise
generally undisputed orthodox news values, while the news values associated with “soft
news ”are less dominant and may be more open to contestation (196).
In their critique of Galtung and Ruge ’s work on news values, Brighton and Foy ( 2007 )
argue that, while “there is still a place for a matrix which sets out the variables ”(3), both the
times and the media have changed since the 1960s. Their consideration of the impact ofbroadcast journalism, rolling news and digital media since the original Galtung and Ruge
study led them to devise their own set of factors to be taken into consideration when
selecting (and analysing) news stories in the twenty- ﬁrst century: Relevance ;Topicality ;
Composition ;Expectation; Unusualness; Worth; and External in ﬂuences . They add that news
values will vary from medium to medium (29).
Discussing the Harcup and O ’Neill ( 2001 ) study, Phillips ( 2015 , 18) argues that conﬂict
should be part of any taxonomy of news values, rather than being subsumed within theWHAT IS NEWS? 1473category of bad news .The Harcup and O ’Neill ( 2001 ) study acknowledged that content
analysis of news outputs fails to make a clear distinction between news selection and
news treatment, and this is explored further by Caple and Bednarek ( 2015 , 11) in research
that offers a complementary discursive approach to how news values are constructed
through various semiotic resources and practices: “With the digitisation of the production
and dissemination of news, news discourse has become a visually enriched product. Thelack of research concerning news values and imagery has been noted by only a handfulof researchers.” They highlight how photography and design emphasise news values
such as superlativeness ,negativity ,personalisation and aesthetic appeal (8–11). Dick ’s
recent study of news values that inform interactive infographics found that, as one intervie-
wee put it, “some visualisations of information can work to challenge conventional news
values ”(Dick 2014 , 499).
“What Works Best on Facebook? ”
In the digital and social media environment, Phillips ( 2015 , 6) notes that while hard
news may be shared on Twitter, it is Facebook that drives more traf ﬁc (Phillips 2012 ). This
importance of Facebook over Twitter when it comes to driving traf ﬁc has been found in
numerous studies, including those by Anderson and Caumont ( 2014 ), Newman ( 2011 )
and Olmstead, Mitchell, and Rosenstiel ( 2011 ). The hugely successful Mail Online “creates
loyalty by giving readers what it already knows that they want” , found Angela Phillips
(2012 , 675), and they know it by observing which stories are the most likely to be shared
by Facebook. “Most of the stories that attract large numbers of hits are also the jokey
stories that people pass on ”, adds Phillips.
Online news therefore presents journalists with instant feedback about whether their
news selection decisions (and methods of presentation) marry with those of signi ﬁcant
numbers of readers. A study of news factors operating in the German media by Wendelin,Engelmann, and Neubarth ( 2015 ,1 2–15) found internet and social media audiences to be
less keen than journalists on politics and other stories of “social signi ﬁcance ”. In a study of
local online news, Schaudt and Carpenter ( 2009 ) note that research about readers ’prefer-
ence for soft or hard news, at least in the United States, is contradictory. Examining thetypes of articles favoured by readers, they found that readers chose to view soft news
about 63 per cent of the time and, unsurprisingly for a local site, the most popular news
value was proximity (76 per cent of stories) followed by conﬂict(31 per cent of stories).
The rise of digital and online media also demonstrate the role that technology and audi-ences play in decisions about what makes the news, with user-generated content becom-
ing more important in news production (Domingo et al. 2008 ). However, Jonsson and
Ornebring ( 2011 ) note that participatory journalism is more prominent in online tabloid
news, and content has relatively little to do with hard news, there being a greater emphasis
on popular culture-orientated content or the personal, building brand loyalty. This knowl-
edge in ﬂuences both selection (Tien Vu 2014 ; Welbers et al. 2015 ) and presentation
(Thurman and Myllylahti 2009 ).
While it must be acknowledged that user-generated content has affected the news
we receive (Domingo et al. 2008 ), somewhat utopian predictions about open-Web democ-
racy revolutionising news production (Beckett 2008 ; Gillmor 2004 ; Rusbridger 2012 )h a v e
not come to pass. Instead of radically changing the production process, the main role per-formed by the bulk of the online audience seems to be sharing and disseminating news on1474 TONY HARCUP AND DEIRDRE O ’NEILLsocial media platforms (Phillips 2012 , 675). As Emily Bell ( 2015 ) puts it: “The key question for
news organisations, tied to the goal of big traf ﬁc, is now ‘what works best on Facebook? ’”
As is evident from this brief literature review, much has been written on news values
since 2001. However, largely absent from the literature are empirical attempts to subject
taxonomies of news values to the type of study that Harcup and O ’Neill set out to
conduct on the original Galtung and Ruge ( 1965 ) criteria. That is what we aim to do with
the study discussed in this article.
Methodology
Analysis of published outputs cannot tell us everything about journalism, of course,
but it can tell us something. Most obviously, it can tell us what has been selected for pub-
lication as news. This can be useful because it can help take our knowledge of what is newsbeyond the anecdotal and the realm of what we may think we know into more systematic
analysis of what has actually been selected. This in turn allows for comparisons (betweendifferent news organisations or platforms, for example, or over time) and can complement
other forms of research such as ethnographic studies, in-depth interviewing or critical dis-
course analysis. Study of published outputs can also be used in an attempt to apply— and
thereby test —scholarly explanations of news values such as that put forward by Galtung
and Ruge. Results of such a study can in turn be used to as a basis for further discussionand exploration about what does (and does not) become news.
Our 2001 study, which was conducted in the hope of doing just that, was based on
content analysis of page-lead news stories published in the United Kingdom ’s three
market-leading daily national newspapers ( The Sun ,Daily Mail and Daily Telegraph )
during a sample month in 1999. Despite predictions of its imminent demise, the printed
press remains worthy of study in part because of the continuing reach of its journalism:
the paid-for titles selected for this study recorded a combined average daily sale of more
than six million copies during the sample month (Ponsford 2014 ), and more than two
million copies of the two free titles are distributed every day (Feeney and Beattie 2013 ;
Press Gazette 2014 ). Circulation on such a scale remains socially signiﬁ cant. In addition, Phil-
lips ( 2012 ) points out that online it is still major news organisations that obtain the largest
proportion of audience share: while the BBC dominates, it is newspapers, notably the Daily
Mail,The Guardian ,The Telegraph and The Sun , which also feature in charts of the top news
originators. Furthermore, she demonstrates that that “Twitter did not make ‘dead tree edi-
tions ’obsolete and it certainly did not render journalists obsolete ”(670). Newspapers also
continue to break major news stories and retain the capacity to inﬂ uence other media, as
highlighted by research suggesting that broadcasters took cues from newspapers ’agenda-
setting during coverage of the 2015 UK general election campaign (Cushion and Sambrook
2015 ). Crucially, the news values of newspapers remain worth studying because what
appears in such publications is by deﬁ nition the result of journalistic selection in a highly
competitive market.
For the new study, rather than simply conduct an exact replica of our earlier one 15
years on, we have expanded it to encompass a wider range of titles: The Sun ,Daily Mail ,
Daily Telegraph ,Daily Mirror ,Daily Express ,The Times ,The Guardian ,The Independent , plus
free-di
stribution dailies Metro and London ’sEvening Standard . A sample week from Novem-
ber 2014 has been selected for each of the 10 newspapers, with titles spread over fourweeks to cover the entire month and avoid results being skewed by one story dominatingWHAT IS NEWS? 1475coverage for days. As with the earlier content analysis, this study is of lead stories published
on news pages, excluding sport, ﬁnance, features and comment pages. This time only the
front and right-hand-side news pages have been considered, because such pages areregarded within the industry as being the prime location for news. Exceptions were
allowed when right-hand pages were given over to full-page advertisements (most fre-
quently in the Telegraph ), when the left-hand page lead may be chosen for analysis.
This resulted in a data-set of 711 stories, each selected by the newspaper as a news
page lead. Each story was then analysed in an effort to identify which, if any, of the Harcup
and O ’Neill ( 2001 ) news values could be detected in the new sample; how news values
interact with each other; and whether any amendments, additions or deletions to the list
of news values might be considered appropriate. Our methodology was deceptively
simple if time-consuming: we read each of the 711 stories and used our 2001 set of
news values as a coding sheet, identifying which if any of the various factors we could
identify in each story. Deciding which news values were present in any particular story
involved a close reading of the text, consideration of the content and an evaluation of
the context (was it following up a story that had originally been published elsewhere, for
example?); the fact that both of us have worked as journalists in addition to studying
and teaching journalism perhaps helped in this process. To ensure consistency each
story was read and coded by both researchers, with disparities in coding discussed
before arriving at consensus. Clearly there is subjectivity involved in such a process —just
as there is subjectivity involved in the journalistic process itself —and we would never
claim anything different. But we nevertheless believe the sample of stories is large
enough to allow for some tentative conclusions to be drawn.
As well as expanding the range of newspapers studied, a further addition has been to
examine a phenomenon little talked about at the time of our original research, let alone
when Galtung and Ruge ﬁrst published: the role of the audience. In the digital age audi-
ences are also selecting and disseminating stories and this in turn is affecting journalists ’
own news selection decisions (Tien Vu 2014 ; Welbers et al. 2015 ). Stories are increasingly
being disseminated on social media platforms through audience recommendations and“shares ”(Olmstead, Mitchell, and Rosenstiel 2011 ; Hermida et al. 2012 ; Phillips 2012 )i n
what Phillips terms “sociability ”. To explore this area alongside our content analysis of
newspapers we also examine which, if any, news values can be identi ﬁed in the case of
the stories from UK news providers that were shared most frequently on Facebook andTwitter. Consideration of the most popular news items shared on social media during
2014, the same year in which data were collected for newspaper output, will inform discus-
sion of the ways in which phenomena such as “sociability ”, or what we call “shareability ”,
may now be taken into consideration by journalists when selecting (or preparing) materialfor publication.
Findings: Newspapers
In considering 711 page lead stories across 10 newspaper titles (see Tables 1 and 2),
ourﬁndings show that bad news is the big winner; but good news is still signi ﬁcant, and
some stories fall into both categories. One example of a story containing both good andbad news appeared in the Telegraph on 20 November 2014: “Britain Bars US ‘Pick-up
artist ’Who Gives £1000 Lessons in Misogyny” . The man is in the news because of his
sexist attitudes (bad news), but this article is about banning him from entering the1476 TONY HARCUP AND DEIRDRE O ’NEILLTABLE 1

that could be interpreted as either good or bad news dependent on the reader ’s viewpoint

with the newspaper ’so w na g e n d a ) ,s u c ha s : “EU Must Change or We Quit ”,t h ef r o n t -
page lead in the Telegraph on 20 November 2014. While all the newspapers favoured
bad news, certain titles leaned mo st heavily towards it, notably the Times (the most
bad news, at 71 stories), Mail,Mirror and Guardian , all with around six times as much
b a dn e w sa sg o o d .
Thisﬁnding that a story might simultaneously be good news and bad news illustrates
that any taxonomy of news values ought not to be thought of as a list of alternatives. It is
clear that one story might tick several boxes, and how certain news values operate in differ-
ent combinations might usefully be an issue for future research.
Perhaps unsurprisingly, surprise is a signi ﬁcant factor, ranking second to bad news
overall. Entertainment was the third biggest news value recorded, but was most prominent
in the Mail, followed by Metro ,Sun,Express and Times . The Sun had the biggest total of
stories recorded as meeting the celebrity criterion. Entertainment and celebrity wereboth more signi ﬁcant in the popular red-top and mid-market titles, although they were
by no means insigni ﬁcant at the quality end of the market, as has been noted previously
(O’Neill 2012 ). The power elite seemed to be of more signiﬁ cance as a news value in the
broadsheet/quality press, possibly because these papers report “serious ”news more promi-
nently. The newspaper ’s own agenda appeared to come into play more in the mid-market
titles than elsewhere, with the Mail and Express between them accounting for more
instances (28) than the other eight titles combined (23). Of course, there may also be
more subtle agendas at work that might require ethnographic study and interviews with
journalists to discern.
Overall, we found many similarities between titles in the snapshot sample as well as
some differences, with freesheets mostly mirroring a mixture of the results from the mid-
markets and red-tops. However, in revisiting our 2001 set of news values, we found that
some categories were too broadly de ﬁned when subjected to empirical testing; someTABLE 2

these are put forward in the Conclusion.
Entertainment encompasses both a dark and light side, which might be better con-
veyed in two distinct categories. Some of the darker but “entertaining ”human-interest
stories might perhaps be more accurately labelled as drama. News stories about sport
could be added to the entertainment mix alongside show business, while the surprise cat-
egory ought to contain “unusualness” within its deﬁ nition. We also noticed that there were
many stories involving large corporations and these might be included within the power
elite category.
There is a case for teasing out the broad deﬁ nition of bad news to add con ﬂict as a
separate category, as has been suggested by Phillips ( 2015 ). We also found ourselves agree-
ing with Caple and Bednarek ( 2015 ) that strong visuals can be a reason for selecting a story,
and that in semiotic terms, a visual can be seen as conveying and emphasising a number of
news factors, such as bad news, drama or surprise. The importance of visuals and, to a lesser
extent, audio became particularly noticeable when considering stories shared on social
media (see below).
On investigation it became apparent that the term “magnitude ”can mean more than
merely involving large numbers; it ought to include extreme behaviours or occurrences (a
man dying in extreme temperatures in an oven, for example, or a particularly unpleasant
crime). Finally, there is a strong case to be made for exclusivity to be considered a news
value in its own right, given the frequency with which we found newspapers drawing atten-
tion to the fact, as in: “a poll by the Times indicates …”(24 November 2014) or “It follows an
investigation by the Independent …” (29 November 2014).
Findings: Social Media
Any study of contemporary news values must now also consider the impact of social
media on the traditional division between the roles of journalists as active (producers, selec-tors, gatekeepers) and of audiences as passive (receivers, consumers). To this end, having
considered news selected by journalists, we then examined those stories that were most
frequently shared on social media by UK news audiences in the same year. Although the
two data-sets have different speci ﬁcations, they nonetheless allow for some preliminary
comparisons of notions of newsworthiness as decided by journalists and audiences,respectively.
Facebook was the most common way of sharing, according to research by journalism.
co.uk , which produced a chart of the “top 10 ”most popular news stories from mainstream
media outlets, as measured by Facebook shares, likes and comments (see Appendix A ).
These ranged from a Mail Online story featuring pictures of icicles, whose 586,250 Facebook
interactions made it the most popular, to a Mirror article about giant spiders, in 10th place
with 315,613 Facebook shares, likes and comments (Albeanu 2015a ).
The“top 10” stories from the same mainstream news outlets as measured by shares
via Twitter suggest that the most shared news items on Facebook were shared many more
times than the most shared news stories on Twitter. The most tweeted story was a Mail
Online piece about a YouTube video teaching dog-owners how to cook treats for their
pets. Also on the list was a Telegraph infographic about Palestinian children killed by
Israeli forces (Albeanu 2015b ). Both items also featured in a different list of the most
tweeted stories of 2014 originating only from national newspaper websites (SearchmetricsWHAT IS NEWS? 14792015 ). By combining these two Twitter lists and removing any repetition it is possible to
identify the “top 15” most tweeted items from news sources in 2014, from the Mail’s
“paw-fect recipes ”at 76,752 tweets to the Sun’s photospread of a scantily clad “supermo-
del”, which was tweeted 17,852 times (see Appendix B ).
Although a crude measure, we took the top 10 Facebook stories and the top 15 most
tweeted stories as being a snapshot of which news stories most interested those members
of the audience using social media in 2014. To that end, we have attempted to identifywhich of the Harcup and O ’Neill ( 2001 ) news values can be said to apply to each of
these 25 stories, and to rank factors in order of frequency (see Table 3 ).
Between the newspaper and social media data-sets, there were some similarities as
well as differences; bad news is almost as popular a factor online as in print. However, themost popular stories online are rarely concerned with the power elite. There may be little
doubt that digital media can help challenge mainstream news agendas, but the most
popular stories do not re ﬂect this democratic ideal. Rather, the most common news
value is entertainment; such stories seem to be shared by online readers because theyare fun, and sharing them can brighten the day. This suggests a possible new news
value as highlighted by previous studies (Olmstead, Mitchell, and Rosenstiel 2011 ;
Hermida et al. 2012 ; Phillips 2012 ; Tien Vu 2014 ; Welbers et al. 2015 ): shareability. Precisely
what qualities give one story more shareability than another are hard to pin down, but
Janine Gibson (a former Guardian website editor who in 2015 became editor-in-chief of
BuzzFeed UK ) has noted that the most shared stories tend to be “stuff that makes you
laugh and stuff that makes you angry” (quoted in Newman 2011 , 24). The quest for share-
able stories is perhaps likely to become an increasingly important consideration withinnewsrooms (Bell 2015 ). As is noted in the Reuters Institute 2015 Digital News Report ,
based on a survey of more than 20,000 people in 12 countries:

fessional news organisations …Twitter tends to work better for serious news brands
like the BBC and New York Times. Facebook tends to favour more accessible content
and brands that focus more on entertainment and lifestyle content such as PlayBuzz ,
theHufﬁngton Post , and BuzzFeed . (Newman 2015 , 81)
So, if news selection —and presentation —becomes dominated by pre-emptive thoughts
about what works best on Facebook, does that inevitably mean that the news agenda
will become increasingly dominated by “soft”entertaining items? The evidence of our
admittedly limited study is mixed, suggesting that the public ’s news preferences may be
more complicated than that.
Celebrity does not dominate social media shares as much as might perhaps have
been predicted, ranking equal seventh in our sample, with the Mail’s celeb-driven
“sidebar of shame ”notable by its absence. Other parts of the Mail’s output were rep-
resented, however, and it provided the most shared story on both Facebook and on
Twitter: both were strong on visuals, with pictures of a frozen Michigan lighthouse captur-ing many people ’s attention on Facebook, while a video on cooking for your pet intriguing
Twitter users. It seems fair to conclude that such visual-led items seem to score highly for“shareability ”on both Facebook and Twitter. While such “soft”stories top both social media
lists, there is also some evidence to back up Phillips ’s view that Twitter can also drive trafﬁ c
to harder news. For example, one of the most shared stories on Twitter was about the
number of Palestinian children killed by Israeli forces, a story that was presented as an info-
graphic demonstrating the deaths over a period of time. The visual nature of this supports
Dick’s(2014 )ﬁnding that something that might not be considered a news story in its own
right —because of the lack of a conventional new news angle or “peg”—can emerge as a
popular item when data over a period of time is given the infographic treatment. The
list of most tweeted stories also included hard news items on the referendum on Scottish
independence and about student protests in Venezuela, neither of which achieved similar
prominence on Facebook (compare Appendix A and Appendix B ).
This preliminary examination of how news values operate on social media is necess-
arily tentative, and it is worth pointing out that many of the people sharing links may not
normally be “readers ”of the news site in question and may only have come across it via a link
in the ﬁrst place. Users of social media may even be sharing links while expressing disagree-
ment with —or disapproval of —a particular item. Such is today ’s journalism landscape.
Conclusion: Towards a Contemporary Set of News Values
Much remains the same, yet much has changed in journalism since Harcup and
O’Neill ( 2001 ) was published. The importance of visuals, highlighted by Caple and Bednarek
(2015 ) and Dick ( 2014 ), is supported by our analysis of news items in both newspapers and
on the most shared lists on social media, leading us to conclude that arresting audio-visuals
are certainly worth listing as a news value in their own right. There is also evidence to
support the arguments of Phillips ( 2015 ) and Schultz ( 2007 ), among others, that con ﬂict
and exclusivity are both worthy of consideration in their own right. Last and probablynot least, the ﬁndings point towards the importance of a concept we call “shareability ”.
Shareability may be hard to deﬁ ne, although Gibson ’s“stuff that makes you laugh and
stuff that makes you angry ”perhaps comes close (Newman 2011 , 24), but it appears toWHAT IS NEWS? 1481be an increasingly important consideration in the selection process (Olmstead, Mitchell,
and Rosenstiel 2011 ; Hermida et al. 2012 ; Phillips 2012 ; Tien Vu 2014 ; Welbers et al. 2015 ).
Future research could usefully explore the extent to which these factors can be ident-
iﬁed in the output of news media across a range of platforms and in different political-econ-
omic contexts. In particular, there is a need for empirical research into whether or not news
organisations ’desire to have their output widely shared on social media may be impacting
on selection decisions; and, if so, with what consequences? We offer this updating of
Harcup and O ’Neill ( 2001 ), which was in turn an attempt to update Galtung and Ruge
(1965 ), in the hope that it will prompt more research into news rather than less.
Theﬁndings of our new study lead us to propose for discussion an updated set of
contemporary news values that, in various combinations, seem to be identi ﬁable within
published news stories. Although there will be exceptions, we have found that potential
news stories must generally satisfy one and preferably more of the following requirements
to be selected:
. Exclusivity : Stories generated by, or available ﬁrst to, the news organisation as a result
of interviews, letters, investigations, surveys, polls, and so on.
. Bad news : Stories with particularly negative overtones such as death, injury, defeat and
loss (of a job, for example).
. Conﬂict: Stories concerning con ﬂict such as controversies, arguments, splits, strikes,
ﬁghts, insurrections and warfare.
. Surprise: Stories that have an element of surprise, contrast and/or the unusual aboutthem.
. Audio-visuals : Stories that have arresting photographs, video, audio and/or which can
be illustrated with infographics.
. Shareability : Stories that are thought likely to generate sharing and comments via Face-
book, Twitter and other forms of social media.
. Entertainment : Soft stories concerning sex, showbusiness, sport, lighter human interest,
animals, or offering opportunities for humorous treatment, witty headlines or lists.
. Drama : Stories concerning an unfolding drama such as escapes, accidents, searches,
sieges, rescues, battles or court cases.
. Follow-up : Stories about subjects already in the news.
. The power elite : Stories concerning powerful individuals, organisations, institutions or
corporations.
. Relevance : Stories about groups or nations perceived to be inﬂ uential with, or culturally
or historically familiar to, the audience.
. Magnitude : Stories perceived as suf ﬁciently signi ﬁcant in the large numbers of people
involved or in potential impact, or involving a degree of extreme behaviour or extremeoccurrence.
. Celebrity: Stories concerning people who are already famous.
. Good news : Stories with particularly positive overtones such as recoveries, break-
throughs, cures, wins and celebrations.
. News organisation ’s agenda : Stories that set or ﬁt the news organisation ’s own agenda,
whether ideological, commercial or as part of a speci ﬁc campaign.
It is important to reiterate that the above criteria can be contested since they are also
governed by practical considerations, such as the availability of resources and time, and sub-jective, often unconscious, in ﬂuences, such as a mix of the social, educational, ideological and1482 TONY HARCUP AND DEIRDRE O ’NEILLcultural in ﬂuences on journalists, as well as the environment in which they work, their pos-
ition in the workplace hierarchy and the type of audience for whom journalists are producing
news. These can cause ﬂuctuations, with certain news values rising up the hierarchy in differ-
ent situations, which may explain why events with similar intrinsic news values are not alwaysgiven the same prominence. Also for online news, the pressure to obtain clicks and shares will
also in ﬂuence decisions about what news to select, as well as news treatment (Thurman and
Myllylahti 2009 ; Phillips 2012 ;B e l l 2015 ). In other words, who is selecting news, for whom ,i n
what medium and by what means (and available resources), may well be as important as
whatever news values may or may not be inherent in any potential story.
Thus, we reiterate that the above news value taxonomy should be seen as a tool for
analysis and further research —designed to provoke discussion and, indeed, contestation —
not something to be churned out as if it is the last word on the subject. And, whenever thequestion arises of why a particular story is seen as newsworthy, there will always remain an
element of truth to the reply: “It just is!”
