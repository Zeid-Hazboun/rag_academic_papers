DEFRAGMENTING NEWS FRAMING 
RESEARCH
Reconciling Generic and Issue- Specific Frames
Michael Brüggemann and Paul D’Angelo
T wenty- five years ago, Entman (1993) made a clarion call for communication 
scholars to use the framing concept to bring together “insights and theories that 
would otherwise remain scattered in other disciplines” (p.  51); “By bringing 
together ideas in one location, communication can aspire to become a master dis-
cipline that synthesizes related ideas and concepts and exposes them to the most 
rigorous, comprehensive statement and exploration” (p. 51). There is no doubt 
that framing has thrived in media studies. As Vliegenthart and van Zoonen (2011) 
pointed out, the number of published studies on media framing, particularly work 
focusing on news, has not waned since Bryant and Miron (2004) showed that 
framing had become an ascendant concept in media research by the turn of the 
20th century. Along the way, some observers have argued that framing has indeed 
become the integrative concept Entman envisioned would move the discipline 
forward (D’Angelo, 2002; Reese, 2001, 2007). Following Entman’s early diagnosis, 
however, the fractured or fragmented paradigm is still a master narrative of framing 
research, often percolating into the literature reviews of individual studies intent 
on repairing it.
Attempts to “defragment” news framing analysis inevitably confront a 
dilemma. As Shah, McLeod, Gotlieb, and Lee (2009) put it, “[Rather] than 
merely expressing dismay at the fractured nature of the framing paradigm, perhaps 
researchers should celebrate the diversity of knowledge provided by contrasting 
approaches” (p. 93). Still, they add, “attempts to standardize conceptual and oper-
ational definitions, and to enhance theoretical clarity and coherence, should be 
applauded” (p. 94). Navigating this dilemma sometimes leads to efforts to define 
“frame” or “framing” in rather exclusionary terms. For example, in searching for 
what de Vreese (2012) called a “golden, definitive standard definition of what a Defragmenting News Framing Research 91
9091
frame is” (p. 367), some work advocates jettisoning any conceptual definition that 
appears to be too abstract to guide how textual features of frames are measured in 
media discourses. But such proposals to define frames and framing narrowly— say, 
in terms of Entman’s framing functions (Matthes  they do not and cannot define the whole process (D’Angelo  Kozman, 2017). Complementing these content ana-
lyses are a few studies that turn the tiered approach toward journalists themselves 
in order to see how their frames consist of a layered structure of topic- specific and 
generic frames (e.g., Engesser  self vs. other). In sum, considerations coded within the gen-
eric frames yielded four distinct thematic hybrid frames, called hope, fear, charity, 
and shame (see Boydstun  Reese, 2001, 2010; Van Gorp, 2010). Thus, to news sources, issue- specific 
frames are not merely considerations that they express piecemeal but themes they 
may consciously and strategically tap and employ within message campaigns. In 
many cases, these campaigns are designed to garner media coverage; this, in turn, 
assures the cultural status of the issue frames, whereby their ontological status 
supersedes individual expression.
Tier 1 analyses naturally push researchers to understand and examine the 
active role journalists play in shaping the issue culture. Thus, in the Tier 2 stage of 
a content analysis, the overarching goal is to understand how journalists process 
the information that subsequently becomes part of the reports, analysis stories, 
and opinion pieces of news publications. Using a constructionist perspective on 
news framing, Gamson and Modigliani (1989) theorized that journalists of all 
stripes reflect an issue culture by circulating sources’ issue frames and actively 
shape it by “contribut[ing] to their own frames and invent[ing] their own clever 
catchphrases, drawing on a popular culture that they share with their audi-
ence” (p. 3). In Van Gorp’s (2010) explication of this perspective, journalists are 
attuned not only to the myriad considerations from their sources but also to 
the culturally embedded themes, such as narratives, values, and archetypes, that 
infuse the myriad considerations on an issue that sources express. To him, these 
sorts of themes are the prime ingredients of journalist frames. Pan and Kosicki 
(1993) noted, too, that big themes of this sort are part of the cognitive repertoire 
journalists use to find proper angles for stories. These cognitive frames are rooted 
in the cultural repository of frames available to journalists (Brüggemann, 2014) 
and contain aspects of both generic and issue- specific, as traditionally conceived. 
In fact, Engesser and Brüggemann (2016) showed how journalist frames develop 
organically:  By listening to— and covering— source considerations, journalist 
frames take the form of themes immersed in topic domains and issue cultures, 
which is much the same form as the hybrid news frames that journalists play an 
active role in shaping in the first place.
As a practical matter, as Van Dijk (1988) said, for journalists to process informa-
tion entails “some form of discourse processing”:Defragmenting News Framing Research 99
9899
Hence, the construction of news is most of all a reconstruction of available 
discourses. The interpretation processes, the representation and retrieval 
from memory of these discourses— at various stages until their final form— 
make up one of the basic but ill- understood components of news produc-
tion. (p. 28)
News framing researchers continue to make progress in understanding how news 
production relates to news framing.3 Y et, the Tier 2 phase can make two unique 
contributions to news framing analysis.
First, by stressing the active role generic frames play in shaping an issue culture, 
researchers can supplant the dominant but sterile definition which says that generic 
frames are generalizable across topics and, instead, see them as integral to theory-<br />
driven explanations for how news production is connected with news framing in 
coverage of particular issues. Sometimes, the rationale for Tier 2 is expressed in a 
somewhat clinical way, as when Boydstun and Glazier (2013) note that generic 
framing can be investigated “in conjunction with” issue- specific frames (p. 710). 
We prefer the more active characterization of Tier 2, which conceives the generative 
role of journalism in terms of   “packaging” information. For example, Kozman 
(2017) noted, “Whereas issue- specific frames reveal what aspects of an issue were 
selected and what we left out, generic frames tell us more about the way the media 
package any issue.” As such, generic frames “take more of an interpretive, packaging 
role that could work in tandem with any issue- specific frame” (p. 780).
The second way that Tier 2’s emphasis on generic framing has the potential 
to move news framing analysis forward is that it forces researchers to pay closer 
attention to a facet of newsgathering that consumes all working journalists: their 
sources. As Sigal (1973) noted, “The sources a newsman [sic] talks to largely shape 
what he reports” (p. 2). Our model depicts generic framing as an iterative pro-
cess through which journalists learn about issues from their sources’ consider-
ations; however, they also filter and inflect this information in line with their own 
expertise. But precisely who are journalists listening to? Kovach and Rosenstiel 
(2010) remind us that there are many different kinds of sources. In their view, 
dissecting precisely who these sources are is vital to judging the quality of infor-
mation they provide. News can be sourceless, whereby a story is written or told 
from the audience’s perspective. At times, ordinary people often are tapped to pro-
vide firsthand accounts of an event, especially if they participated in it. Of course, a 
journalist can witness the event, too. And, for issues that require more background, 
context, and analysis, journalists regularly go to officials and credentialed experts. 
Because generic framing is iterative— that is, it happens within a newsroom’s 
beats and routines and in connection with the production and expression of issue 
frames— researchers need to consider from where issue frames come, and how gen-
eric framing is influenced by these sources. As Gamson and Modigliani (1989) 
demonstrated in a seminal news framing study, only after work is done on that 
level can the “central organizing idea” of an issue culture be fleshed out.100 Michael Brüggemann and Paul D’Angelo

Observing Issue Frames in Conjunction with Values
Journalists, and in particular beat journalists, are exposed to many different 
kinds of considerations— and, as noted, their own expertise about an event or 
issue derives at least in part from what they learn from these considerations. 
Accordingly, one area from which research on tiered models of hybrid framing 
can benefit is framing research that advances our understanding of issue framing. 
Here, political science scholars who study framing have moved the needle for-
ward, particularly in developing models of framing effects built on the audiences’ 
cognitive sub- routines of accessibility and applicability, which some theories 
see as distinct processes (Scheufele, 2000) but in reality are integrated in a fully 
articulated news framing process (Chong  Slothuus, 
2008). Specifically, framing research in political science has done more to parse the 
components of issue frames than other areas of framing research. In linking issue 
frames to a communicator’s values (e.g., Nelson  Pan  Sniderman  limited because...

106given the potential connection between climate change and storms, which is an 
area that has not been explored sufficiently, we might see that the considerations 
articulated by sources to argue in support of or against the hypothesis of anthropo-
genic climate change differ from those used in coverage of other events related to 
climate change, say, legislation or international treaties. Obviously, how valence is 
used in the issue framing of these events— for instance, how a solution is framed 
on the basis of obtaining a gain or suffering a loss, which Levin et al. (1998) call 
goal equivalency framing— would differ, too.
Just as issue framing takes on a particular shape vis- à- vis circumstances related 
to a topic, so does generic framing. As we have argued, the thematic hybrid 
frames contain traces of the information processing on the part of journalists. 
Thus, to fully comprehend the issue culture as articulated circumstantially, case 
by case, researchers must investigate, typically via survey techniques, journalists’ 
thoughts and values related to the issue (e.g., Engesser  interviewing 
strategies; editorial meetings) to cover— and frame— the issue.
Conclusion
Conceiving of frames as hybrids of issue- specific frames and generic frames 
represents a promising way to defragment news framing analysis. It provides a way 
to see issue framing and generic framing as part of a holistic process that ultim-
ately becomes represented analytically in terms of a topic-  or domain- specific 
typology with hybrid frames located at the center. The approach we advocate 
also helps fine- tune prospective research that may hold on to an analytically sterile 
conception of generic framing as being contextualizing discourses that are gen-
eralizable to any topic- related area. The downside of such a conception is that 
generic frames become used uncritically, without the required inductive analyses 
that could determine whether in fact they belong in the analysis.
The tiered analyses we recommend for news framing can help in ongoing 
efforts to uncover shifts in issue frames and generic frames over time. In fact, 
the generic frames listed in the left- hand column of Table 5.4 partially illustrate 
this: what looks like a pre- defined set of frames is actually accumulated from a 
series of content analyses, whereby three frames— technological/ scientific pro-
gress, disaster (or Pandora’s box/ Frankenstein’s monster/ runaway science), and a 
scientific uncertainty frame— were added in later (for related research, see Durant, 
Bauer,  Gamson  however, it is crucial to remain open 108 Michael Brüggemann and Paul D’Angelo
108108
to the specific articulations of generic frames (e.g., how the strategy frame differs 
in coverage of science topics and election settings). In all, hybrid frames need to be 
closely tracked in order to understand an issue culture at a particular point in time 
and over time, as well as across different media platforms, and, in more ambitious 
designs, cross- nationally.
Notes
 1 Editor’s Note: The chapter by Hatley Major (this volume) discusses the merits of com-
bining issue- specific and generic frames in research on coverage of health issues.
 2 Editor’s Note: The chapter by Busby, Flynn, and Druckman (this volume) discusses the 
expectancy value model in news framing analysis.
 3 Editor’s Note: The chapter by Boesman and Van Gorp (this volume) deals with the latest 
ethnographic techniques of newsroom analysis that contribute to our understanding of 
frame building.
 4 These values are focused on the US context.
 5 The shootings at the Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut, 
occurred on Friday, December 14, 2012. Subsequent events, such as the press conference 
of the National Rifle Association on December 21, and later, President Obama’s speech 
on January 16, 2013 calling for stricter gun controls, garnered much press coverage, 
which upon empirical examination would likely support the proposition that advocates 
expressed their views (re: considerations) in terms of values.
 6 Specific topics within these domains include biotechnology, nuclear energy, and 
nanotechnology.
