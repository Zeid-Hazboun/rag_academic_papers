This themed issue provides a comprehensive overview of journalism scholarship that var-
iously builds on, develops, and re-examines the conceptual and methodological frame-
work of “news values” research. As such, it purports to demonstrate, explore and re ﬂect
on its distinctive merits and limitations, both actual and potential, as a distinctive
approach to understanding ideas, practices, and experiences of “newsworthiness ”, and
indeed “news” , in a media landscape and journalistic ﬁeld that continues to evolve.
Questions about what constitutes “news” (to whom) and how “news” comes about and
takes shape, are key to journalism studies. In a general sense, the exchange of new infor-mation has historically ful ﬁlled basic human needs for orientation, connection, and secur-
ity (Kovach and Rosenstiel 2001; Stephens 2014). A more speci ﬁc notion of “the news”
grew entangled with journalism, though, as the production and dissemination ofrecent public information through the generic form of “news stories ”(Rantanen 2009)
© 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor  Hall 1973).
However, in an insightful assessment of the “news values ”research tradition,
Caple and Bednarek ( 2016) argue that, in the process, the concept of “news values”
has been stretched so far as to include “anyfactor or criterion ”aﬀecting news selection
and treatment ( p. 438, emphasis in original) as well as what could be consideredgeneral “news writing objectives ”(ibid.; see also Bednarek and Caple 2017
or Strömbäck, Karlsson, and Hopmann 2012).
 In order to preserve the notion ’s useful-
ness as an analytical approach in its own right, they propose, therefore, to retain anarrow conception of news values/newsworthiness as “the values that establish the
worth of an event to be reported as news” (ibid.). Moreover, and importantly, it is
argued that largely implicit in the extant literature on “news values” is a multidimen-
sional understanding of newsworthiness, which has translated, correspondingly, intodiﬀerent research foci and methodological approaches (Caple and Bednarek 2016; Bed-
narek and Caple 2017). As such, previous studies have mainly deﬁ ned “news values”
either or both in terms of (identifying) the material aspects of an event or issue thatrender it potentially newsworthy, the cognitive belief systems of journalists and/or
audiences, or the shared routines and codes learned and practiced through socializa-
tion in (particular) newsrooms and journalistic communities (ibid.).
What characterizes the state of the ﬁeld, then, is a primary focus on clarifying and
explaining why particular events are or may be considered newsworthy, which conceptu-
alizes “news values” as external to and pre-existing news talk and text (ibid.). Yet, this
tends to overlook or background how “news values” are communicated and in fact
mutually constituted through the various semiotic resources of language and imagethat make up (news) discourse (ibid.; cf. Hartley 1982). More or less along the same
lines, Galtung and Ruge ( 1965) previously asserted in their “distortion hypothesis ”that
“[o]nce a news item has been selected what makes it newsworthy according to the
factors will be accentuated ”(p.71). Shifting attention from the “why”of“news selection ”
to the “how ”of“news treatment ”, then, a discursive approach —developed by Bednarek
and Caple into a Discursive News Values Analysis (DNVA) analytical framework— asserts
itself as a complementary, constructivist perspective on “news values” as (negotiable) dis-
cursive constructs or practices (ibid.; Bednarek and Caple 2017). Interestingly, DNVA
opens up to conceptual and methodological cross-fertilizations in journalism studies,
for instance with the well-established framework of “framing ”through the notion of “sal-
ience” (Moernaut, Mast, and Temmerman 2019),
or analyses of news form and style
(Broersma 2010 ; Schudson 1978).690 J. MAST AND M. TEMMERMANConsiderations of “newsworthiness ”along each of these dimensions have shifted in
the contemporary media environment, where the vectors of change a ﬀecting the way
“news” develops, is exchanged and communicated and, indeed, essentially understood,
have been manifold, and where a general sense of self-re ﬂexivity and transparency has
manifested itself. For the conditions and a ﬀordances of a networked, participatory
media culture have considerably extended the range of sources and voices, or infor-
mation and stories surrounding and potentially feeding into the daily news stream. Intandem with the di ﬀusion of digital media technologies, various kinds of “newcomers”
have emerged, who occupy hybrid positions encapsulated in notions such as “produser ”
(Bruns 2009)o r “in-betweener” (Ahva 2017 ), and both emulate and transform journalistic
codes and conventions. The positionalities of these bottom-up actors not only add new
inﬂections to established news selection criteria but equally challenge legacy media ’s
longtime status as “primary de ﬁners”of news. In this environment, where news is
“ambient ”(Hermida 2010), social media, search engines and (automated) news aggrega-
tors, and the algorithms and web analytics that drive them, have become key to (under-
standing) journalistic routines and news circulation. On the production ’s end, these
technologies allow— and urge —the careful monitoring both of news ﬂows for input
and story idea generation (cf. Gans 1979), and audience (inter)activity —which stories
are clicked, liked, shared, or commented upon, and (thus) succeed in generating tra ﬃc.
As such, considerations of “clickability ”and “shareability ”(Harcup and O ’Neill 2017),
search engine or social media optimization, feed into the editorial process and the selec-
tion and “de-selection ”of news items (Tandoc 2014). By the same token, on the distri-
bution and reception side, a networked media culture entails multiple manifestations
of“secondary gatekeeping” (Nielsen 2016),
whether by human intervention or (largely)
automated, leading to the articulation of highly customized, personalized and, therefore,in a sense “de-industrialized ”(Broersma and Peters 2013) “news diets ”and corresponding
perceptions of “newsness” (Edgerly and Vraga 2017) —observations which also link up
with the associated phenomena of the “ﬁlter bubble ”and “echo chamber ”(see also Tem-
merman and Mast 2020).
From a “meta ”perspective, these shifting routines and belief systems ultimately open
new conversations on the constituent elements of “news” . For while it could be argued
that the “news paradigm ”reached an apotheosis in the 24/7, “breaking news” culture
where news is always “on”,“hard ”news has become less of a marker of distinction for pro-
fessional journalism in the light of shrinking news cycles and the sheer availability of news
(online). Against the background of a highly competitive, fragmented news market, and a
cultural atmosphere of (self-)re ﬂexivity, a renewed interest in “other ”, non-traditional and
often marginalized, journalistic genres and news discourses has emerged. What is implied,
then, is the reexamination of the normative assumptions and epistemologies of “hard
news” . This occurs, notably, through the proliferation of “soft”and hybrid news, and
the (re)invigoration of narrative and interpretive news discourses, including (but notlimited to) digital, multimodal genres. Additionally, alternative forms of journalism have
taken shape around particular critiques of traditional norms and practices guidingnews production, including its basis in “news values” . So, for example, inspired by the
principles of positive psychology, “constructive ”and “solutions-oriented ”journalism (Gyl-
densted 2015;
Mast, Coesemans, and Temmerman 2019) attempts to remedy mainstream
news’ s (perceived) emphasis on “negativity ”, whereas the “slow journalism ”movementJOURNALISM STUDIES 691proposes to replace its “event ”-centeredness and “immediacy ”with “slow news values”
which move beyond and behind the daily news cycle (Le Masurier 2015).
This renewed context of news production, circulation, and use, ushered in by digitiz-
ation, compels journalism scholars to re-assess the merits and limitations of the “news
values” framework, and embrace or explore approaches that are (more) attuned to the
digital, networked environment. Clearly, such e ﬀort not only entails reorienting the
topical focus of research, to evolving journalistic principles, practices and forms, and to
shifting notions of “news(worthiness)” , but also pertains to a (re-)consideration of the
epistemologies and methodologies guiding news values research. As such, this specialissue brings together contemporary conceptual, methodological and/or empiricalstudies that variously contribute to the outlined research agenda. It does so by presenting
scholarly work (1) situated across the constituent dimensions of news values analysis and
articulating interactions between material, cognitive, social, and discursive perspectives;
(2) considering the diversity of news actors and normative conceptions that make up
the fragmented ﬁeld of journalism; (3) crossing disciplinary boundaries within the hetero-
genous domain of journalism studies by integrating theoretical perspectives and explor-ing multi-method approaches; and/or (4) engaging digital media(technologies) or tools
either as an object of study or a methodological approach.
We set o ﬀour exploration of this proposed research agenda with Bednarek, Caple and
Huan ’s contribution Computer-Based Analysis of News Values: A Case Study on National Day
Reporting . In this paper, the authors build on the aforementioned interdisciplinary frame-
work of Discursive News Values Analysis (DNVA), which they developed and applied inprevious work. Importantly, bridging linguistics and journalism studies, DNVA comp-lements other established approaches in news values research by shifting focus from
“news selection ”and news values as “atextual or pretextual ”categories, to “news presen-
tation ”and how news values are “discursively constructed ”through various semiotic
resources. While this analytical approach typically involves large measures of interpret-ation and work in this area, therefore, has typically been conducted manually, the
present study aims to further the idea of disciplinary cross-fertilization by integratingcomputer-assisted techniques that are well-established in corpus linguistics and otherareas of digital humanities. Indeed, the authors see particular strength in the combination
of automated, quantitative and manual, qualitative methods, and thus the emphasis is onhow tools like word frequency lists, collocation and concordancing, as well as visualiza-tions of word co-occurrence, may aid— rather than replace —the interpretive textual
analysis that they consider to be integral to DNVA.
Set against the background of shifting public discourses and growing societal divisions
regarding Australia’ soﬃcial national day, which remembers the beginning of coloniza-
tion, Bednarek, Caple and Huan apply the proposed approach to the recent coverageof Australia Day in two major Australian newspapers. Most notably, the authors ﬁnd
strong indications of Negativity, a sentiment that is typically marginal to or absent
from mainstream news discourses on national day events generally. Elements of Nega-
tivity are evident both in the occurrence of alternative expressions for the national day,such as “invasion day ”and “survival ”day,
 yet, also in the immediate co-text of the
most common, “neutral ”term “Australia day ”. This suggests, it is argued, that the “material
reality ”of controversy and grievance increasingly surrounding Australia ’s national day,
informs journalists ’perceptions of the event’ s newsworthiness which, in turn, translates692 J. MAST AND M. TEMMERMANinto the treatment —or discursive construction —of the news reporting. As such, the
broader implications of this case study are not limited to the methodological potentials
it demonstrates and sketches out, but they also pertain to the contextual nature ofnews values analysis and national day research, and the ensuing need for cross-cultural
comparative approaches in these areas.
The argument for a computer-aided approach to news values analysis also resonates in
Philip Meyer ’s paper Promoted Media Coverage of Court Decisions: Media Gatekeeping of
Court Press Releases and the Role of News Values . This study provides an original angle
on well-documented issues in journalism (studies) pertaining to news selection, journal-
ist-source relationships, and, ultimately, journalistic autonomy, by looking at judicialpublic relations and justice reporting through the lens of news values. Adopting compu-
tational methods and bridging disciplinary ﬁelds in doing so, Meyer purports to advance
the empirical foundation for a theoretical model that helps explain the “media success ”of
court communication. Building on the notion of “intereﬃ cation ”, the present focus is on
the mutual dependency between routine considerations of “newsworthiness ”, and
decision-promoting press releases of the German Federal Constitutional Court (FCC),
which are selectively issued to establish openness and, in the process, assertiveness,
with the general public.
In order to shed light on this interaction underlying day-to-day news work, Meyer
develops a comprehensive research design integrating automated and manual content
analysis that enables to ascertain methodically whether the FCC ’s“information subsidies ”
(Gandy 1982) are picked up by German quality newspapers, and to what extent particular
news value(s) increase the probability of selection. Looking at the entire population of“decision-promoting ”press releases issued by the FCC and all available newspaper cover-
age mentioning the court, which appeared over the course of a 10-year period (2008 –
2018), algorithmic computation is used to measure the “textual alignment ”between
press releases and news reports published within 10 days of publication of the release.
Next, through manual coding of a random subsample of these news article/press
release “dyads” , and testing the results against the previously identi ﬁed“textual align-
ment scores ”, a threshold for measuring “media success ”is determined —indicating
whether a promoted court decision is explicitly referenced and/or copied by at least
one news report. Finally, the “independent variable ”of newsworthiness is coded
through a full-text screening of the original court decisions, looking speci ﬁcally for
common phrases and acronyms. This proceeds on the idea that the distinct nature ofcourt decisions and justice reporting entails that newsworthiness needs to be understood,
here, in terms of “political magnitude ”. As such, following previous research, Meyer argues
that three indicative news values can be identi ﬁed:“conﬂict”(referring
 to both political
and legal oppositions); “political power ”(denoting institutional, Court branches); and
“familiarity ”(which would in this case follow from previously held public oral hearings).
The analysis also controls for length (complexity) of the decision text and the press
release, and possible time e ﬀects.
The results show that (only) 18% of promoted court decisions succeed in being
reported on in the press, which compares with the ﬁndings of existing research in
related areas such as political and organizational communication. Moreover, it appearsthat in cases involving “conﬂict”and “political power ”, where it is said that the need of
the courts to in ﬂuence public information is most pertinent, press releases don ’t have aJOURNALISM STUDIES 693substantial impact on news content (and at best serve as a trigger for further, “original ”
reporting). Conversely, “familiarity ”of the issue on the news agenda and with the
general public, informed by previous oral hearings, does signi ﬁcantly in ﬂuence “media
success ”. It is concluded, then, that the present study provides no empirical support to
the “normatively justi ﬁed concern ”about the impact of public relations on news
content and copy/paste journalism. Yet, this comes with the important caveat that at
least to some extent, cost-e ﬃciency considerations do seem to be at play in the observed
“oral hearing ”follow-up reporting. By the same token, further research into editing prac-
tices and the substance and accuracy of journalistic work is needed to be able to makenormative judgements about the impact of active court communication on the qualityof justice reporting and public information.
Like Meyer ’s study, the third paper in this themed issue, “Cross-Editing” : Comparing
News Output Through Journalists ’Re-working of Their Rivals ’Scripts, by Vivien Marsh,
sheds light on the role of news values at the production side of the news process. Yet,
whereas the source-journalist perspective adopted above primarily considered measures
of alignment between promoted content and news output, the present study shifts focusspeciﬁcally to the analysis of news editing practices and news discourse. In doing so, it
also continues the agenda of methodological innovation, complementing the macro-level and (partly) automated approaches of the previous two contributions by proposinga framework for collaborative and comparative news values research at micro-level. Inwhat is referred to as “cross-editing ”, professional and organizational routines, including
conceptions of newsworthiness, are examined through the analysis of participant-gener-ated content by having journalists working at two distinct news organizations edit eachother ’s work and re ﬂect on the process. While the method is in ﬂuenced by related creative
methodologies that purport to illuminate editorial processes, including comparativeexperimental textual analysis, reconstruction interviews, and progression analysis, whatsets “cross-editing ”apart is the explicit focus on the ﬁnal stage of editorial decision-
making and, above all, the active participation of the object of study, professional journal-ists, in the data collection and analysis. Engaging the principle of “citizen science ”, the
approach enables to bridge the gap between academia and practice, and thus ultimatelytransposes the ideas of connectivity and participation that permeate the network culture
to the scholarly ﬁeld.
Marsh tests the method and the comparative dimension implied, in a cross-cultural
analysis of editorial decision-making conducted with a small sample of news deskeditors from BBC and China ’soﬃcial English-language news provider CCTV-News (now
CGTN). These “cross-editors ”each received a transcript (and corresponding video ﬁle)
of a news item from the “rival”broadcasting
 station, which they were then asked to evalu-
ate, annotate and edit as they saw ﬁt. Informed by the preliminary ﬁndings of a pilot
study, the “main ”cross-edit centered on randomly selected broadcasts of an event in
which both countries had a stake —the 2014 Hong Kong protests —and one in which
neither country was directly involved —the 2015 Charlie Hebdo attacks in Paris. Integrat-
ing discourse and discursive news values analysis, an in-depth scrutiny is carried out of the
reformulations and lexical choices as well as selections and omissions, proposed anddeliberated by the cross-editors regarding each other ’s work.
Theﬁndings indicate both elements of di ﬀerentiation, most evident in the Hong Kong
case, and consensus, most distinctive of the reporting of the Charlie Hebdo event. In694 J. MAST AND M. TEMMERMANterms of news values, the analysis points out, for instance, that disagreements on the
news treatment of the Hong Kong protests and mutual accusations of “bias”particularly
pertained to expressions and interpretations of “superlativeness” ,“impact ”, and “nega-
tivity ”—and related to the latter, the foregrounding of the social value of “harmony ”in
Chinese reports. In general, the study thus demonstrates and clari ﬁes how both interna-
lized professional and sociopolitical or cultural values shape routine judgments of news-
worthiness and editing practices. Marsh concludes by providing a procedural frameworkand possible avenues for future “cross-editing ”research, whose comparative rationale
could be applied to other contexts and theoretical lenses and holds a lot of potentialin a globalized —or interconnected— and increasingly diversi ﬁed (news) media landscape.
The idea of diversi ﬁcation, essentially implied in comparative research like Marsh ’s
cross-editing study, resonates particularly in the digital era where the range of newsactors has multiplied. The manifold forms and practices that have come to co-existwith traditional journalism and legacy media prompts students of news values to
widen the analytical lens and take a more encompassing approach that acknowledges
“newcomers” in the ﬁeld asserting legitimacy and authoritative status.
This understanding underlies the next two papers in this edited collection, the ﬁrst of
which focuses on a case of “alternative ”, citizen media, which have variously emerged
alongside and frequently in opposition to mainstream news outlets. In Casual, Colloquial,
Commonsensical: A News Values Stylistic Analysis of a Populist Newsfeed , Molek-Koza-
kowska and Wilk investigate the genre of “propaganda as news”— or, partisan public
information by-passing yet resembling conventional news —provided on the American
Tea Party’ soﬃcial website. Approaching populism as a proliferating a ﬀective “communi-
cative style ”strategically aimed at garnering political support, the authors take this grass-
roots, right-wing newsfeed as a prototypical case of mediated populist discourse, and setout to explore the discursive features of its demonstrated popular appeal.
In doing so, the original contribution of this study is twofold. Besides charting new ter-
ritory by shedding light on aspects of newsworthiness in the context of a non-traditional“news” genre, it also pioneers an integrated methodology intersecting discursive news
values and stylistic analysis to lay bare how the populist newsfeed succeeds in aligningcommunicatively with the cognitive and emotional preferences of its target audience.
Drawing a “constructed week ”sample of newsfeed headlines posted in the “All News ”
section
of the populist newsfeed in spring 2019, the authors adapt Bednarek and
Caple ’s DNVA approach outlined above while complementing it with an analysis of
style, operationalized as “bundles of lexical, grammatical, register and compositional
resources. ”Building on established insights about the particular capacity of communica-
tive style to induce audience engagement, three discursive patterns characteristic ofpopulist discourse, referred to in the article title, are discerned and exempliﬁ ed.
In terms of “newsworthiness ”, it is found, ﬁrst, that the newsfeed headlines are satu-
rated with markers of “personalization ”and “proximity ”, which, thus, can be considered
“normalized ”and in this sense “constitutive ”features of populist media communication
(largely) explaining its popular appeal. Further diﬀ erentiating how “news” is conceived
and discursively constructed on the feed, “eliteness” and “negativity ”prove salient, com-
monly entwined categories, a pattern that corresponds with populist sentiments of anti-establishment, authoritarianism and a “politics of fear ”. These ﬁndings are supplemented
by the stylistic analysis, which articulates the sensationalizing, stigmatizing, moralizingJOURNALISM STUDIES 695and simplifying nature of the populist newsfeed ’s discourse through its distinct repertoire
of informality, authenticity and entertainment emerging from the persistent use of
“casual ”speech, “colloquialisms ”such as nicknames or oﬀ ensive labels, humor, and “com-
monsensical ”us/them polarizations. As the biased “newsfeed diet ”cultivated as such,
reinforces a communal bond built on shared values and a sense of self-righteousness,while antagonizing and discrediting opponents, its mobilizing power contributes to theformation of populist information bubbles and, consequently, a fragmented publicsphere. Resonating particularly well with a “post-truth ”atmosphere and the implications
of a highly mediatized, networked society, as Molek-Kozakowska and Wilk argue, a “popu-
list communicative logic ”becomes more pervasive, urging political communication scho-
larship to understand the role of this kind of “pseudo-journalistic ”media genres, across
political right/left divisions, in shaping public discourse, hence democratic debate. Thispaper, and the proposed analytical protocol, oﬀ ers scholars heeding this call a fruitful
foundation to work from.
The next paper, Eﬀects of News Factors on Users ’News Attention and Selective Exposure
on a News Aggregator Website , by Luebke, Engelmann and Kessler, maintains this themed
issue ’s engagement with fresh methodological approaches to news values research, while
also re-locating its analytical focus, like the previous, “populist newsfeed ”study, outside
traditional journalism, to the new sorts of “news” providers that have emerged in the
digital media landscape. Whereas Molek-Kozakowska and Wilk ’s interest, here, was in
teasing out how grassroots media emulate conventional notions of “newsworthiness ”,
the main question guiding the present study, which shifts attention to the user perspec-tive, is to what extent traditional “journalistic relevance criteria ”persist in the renewed
context of news aggregator websites, where processes of news selection are primarily
determined by algorithms. Key to the argumentation is the notion of “news cues ”,o r
the formal presentation features of news items (such as position, length, or accompanying
picture) which have been empirically demonstrated to direct users ’selective attention
and exposure to news. Although such cues clearly predate the digital era, consideringnews users’ essentially limited cognitive capacity to pay attention to and process infor-
mation, their navigational role has arguably become ever-more relevant in the high-choice environment of news aggregator websites. At the same time, their application
has become largely technology-driven and, thus, no longer exclusively de ﬁned by pro-
fessional editorial judgement. As this raises the empirical question and normative
concern to what degree conventional considerations of newsworthiness remain relevant
to understanding news selection in an aggregator context, the authors argue it is impera-
tive to investigate news factors ’direct eﬀect
 on users’ news selection as well as possible
indirect eﬀects materializing through interaction with algorithmically driven news cues.
Interestingly, the authors do so by using a “mixed methods” study design that com-
bines a standardized content analysis of news items with an eye-tracking observationof users, which allows for a more “objective ”coding of news selection practices than tra-
ditional measurement techniques that rely on self-reporting. A sample of 47 student par-ticipants, recruited at a German university, were asked to browse the quintessential newsaggregator website Google News, to obtain a general overview of the news. By trackingeye movements, participants ’“news attention ”, operationalized as “dwell time ”, and
“selective exposure ”, or the more “overt action ”of clicking a news item, were measured.
Subsequently, each news item users paid attention to was coded for “news factor ”and696 J. MAST AND M. TEMMERMAN“news cues ”, as independent variables informing users’ selection decisions. In addition to
a set of formal presentation cues (with source credibility, recency and number of related
articles added to the aforementioned examples), the analysis of the “news factor ”com-
ponent is con ﬁned to four “collective relevance indicators ”which have been shown in
previous research to succeed in arousing interest and thus in ﬂuence news selection:
“power elite” (powerful persons, institutions or nations have more societal impact), “pro-
minence” (idem for well-known persons), “proximity ”(physically or culturally nearby is
more likely to be considered relevant) and “conﬂict”(of a political or non-political
nature, which potentially has social implications and/or a ﬀects personal well-being),
while news item “topic ”was used as a control variable.
Consistent with the ﬁndings of similar, previous user studies conducted on traditional
media, the results con ﬁrm the crucial role of formal presentation features in guiding news
users’ attention, and their mediating position between news factors and news selection
process. What is more, no direct e ﬀects of “news factors ”on the items users pay attention
to or click, were found, which leads to the important observation that in the presentcontext of aggregated news provision, where information is abundant, news cues ’
“partial mediations become full mediations. ”A mixed picture emerges, then, with
(young) news users relying strongly on prominent formal cues rather than a sharedsense of newsworthiness when browsing aggregated news content, while at the sametime traditional news factors do remain relevant predictors in the, admittedly, morecomplex workings of algorithmically deﬁ ned news. While these ﬁndings, from a normative
perspective, may be seen as a ﬃrmative, nuancing concerns about eroding journalistic
principles and growing audience fragmentation in the digital era, the authors point outthat caution is warranted, and further research needed, in light of algorithms ’nubilous
nature, changing news consumption patterns, and the exigencies of a market-driven,metric media landscape.
Moving on to the ﬁnal section of this themed issue, the primary focus shifts toward
concept development, with the two remaining papers variously proposing to thinkbeyond and expand established understandings of newsworthiness.
Theﬁrst,Attention for Attention Hotspots: Exploring the Newsworthiness of Public
Response in the Metric Society , by Fürst and Oehmer, builds on a contextual framework
that links up neatly with that of the preceding, “news aggregator ”study.
Besides taking
similar current developments in the digital era as a starting ground for their analysis,the authors also draw attention to the audience perspective in news values research. In
the previous paper, the described trends were considered as a relevant background,
and impetus, to examine current news selection practices from the user end, and to ascer-tain whether traditional, collective newsworthiness criteria hold up amidst shifting
conﬁgurations of news use. The present study, in turn, engages the idea that aspects
of web analytics and audience fragmentation feed back into “primary ”, editorial gatekeep-
ing (Nielsen 2016) by prompting a renewed conception of news value.
Sketching out the contours of a media culture where technological and economic
transformations have ever-more turned events that succeed in drawing “collective atten-
tion”into a scare and therefore valuable good, while allowing for the continuous moni-
toring and monetization of this attention, “public response ”emerges as a news factor
exhibiting both (intrinsic) cultural meaning and (extrinsic) commercial value —not
unlike journalism generally. These multiple overtones subsequently transpire in theJOURNALISM STUDIES 697conceptualization of the proposed news factor along three dimensions —“audience
response ”,“media response ”, and “event response ”—which are analytically distinguished
and can but need not co-occur within individual news reports. Each refers to explicit state-
ments about actual, expected, or estimated amounts of “response ”, whether in the form
of indications of audience popularity or usage (like ratings, or number of likes, shares, fol-lowers, etc.), meta-coverage of media attention for particular actors or events (or publi-city), and/or descriptions of event participation.
In line with the methodological agenda of this themed issue, the conceptualization of
the newly proposed news factor is further developed into an analytical framework thatallows for qualitative and quantitative measurement. Evoking the discursive approach tonews values analyses (DNVA) adopted in some of the other contributions, “public response ”
is initially operationalized into a set of linguistic (descriptive or metaphorical), numerical andvisual indicators, discerned and exempli ﬁed along its three constituent dimensions through
a case study of (US) news coverage of the 2016 US presidential candidates, Trump and
Clinton. Additionally, these qualitative categories lay the foundation for the quantitative
analysis of the presence or intensity of audience, media, and event response in newsmedia reports, which it is suggested may either take the form of a di ﬀerentiated coding
of the three dimensions at the level of individual statements, or a generalized coding offull articles through a sum index. By providing these tools, this study not only succeedsin carving out a space for the newly proposed category of newsworthiness but alsoenables its recognition and wider adoption in future empirical research along established
news factors. As such, at least part of Fürst and Oehmer ’s contribution lies in calling atten-
tion to evolving notions of newsworthiness and the value of developing a solid and trans-
parent methodology for news values analysis. Yet, based on the case study analysis, the
present article also prompts deeper re ﬂection as it considers possible rami ﬁcations of
“public response ”reporting for journalistic quality. Problematizing the frequently observed
lack of a sense of critical judgement regarding the status of metric data, the strategic objec-tives behind its circulation, and the (self-)reinforcing dynamic underlying this kind of report-
ing, the discussion of “public response ”again —like those provided in the other
contributions in this special issue —reveals news values (analysis) as profoundly implicated
with related, key areas of concern in (the study of) journalism practice.
Similarly, this themed issue ’s closing article, Joy is a news value , by Perry Parks, elevates
the discussion beyond news values analysis per se to a more profound contemplation of
journalistic principles. Premised on the “contingent and constructed ”nature of news
values, Park ’s analysis, like the previous, could be understood as an argument to
rethink newsworthiness in light of the transformations re-shaping contemporary mediaculture. In the case of “public response ”, this materializes in a descriptive sense,
through the observed emergence of a present-day news value immediately associatedwith processes of dataﬁ cation and fragmentation in the digital era. Alternatively, Parks
adopts a meta-journalistic perspective which engages in a re-examination of normative
conceptions and epistemologies concerning “news” , and thus ultimately “journalism ”,
instigated by the shifting practices and discourses in a networked or “de-industrialized ”
(Broersma
and Peters 2013) journalistic ﬁeld. The aim, here, is not so much, or not primar-
ily, to add to extant news values categorizations as it is to interrogate the paradigmaticnotions of news(worthiness) that have been typically implied in such conceptual
frameworks.698 J. MAST AND M. TEMMERMANIn doing so, the rationale of Parks ’analysis aligns with shifting epistemologies in media
research and the journalistic ﬁeld encapsulated in the notion of the “aﬀective turn ”. Pro-
blematizing the traditionally marginalized position of the experiential in normative con-
ceptions of journalism, which have typically esteemed ratio, cognition, and objectivity
over emotion, aﬀ ect and subjectivity, the author sets out to carve out a space for “joy”
as a distinct, and “privileged ”, news value alongside and complementary to paradigmatic
news values categories. As with “public response ”, the present paper proceeds in its e ﬀort
to recognize “joy”as a legitimate and valuable guiding principle in news work by oﬀ ering
both conceptual and methodological re ﬂection. Key to the argument developed here, is
the emphasis throughout on a humanistic understanding of “embodied experience ”and
“aﬀect”that goes beyond social scienti ﬁc, psychometric approaches to emotional
engagement with news. Building on philosophy, theology, and literature, “joy”is
deﬁned as “the cheerful harnessing of human potential in the face of all manner of adver-
sity”and conceptualized as an ephemeral and non-representational a ﬀective response to
life that is generative, empowering, and social. Conceived as a profound approach or deep
attitude that in ﬂuences “how problems are perceived, how people are addressed, how
events are interpreted, how stories are told ”,“joy”is set apart from occasional instances
of constructive, inspirational journalism or isolated, often clichéd “good news ”stories. As
a way of o ﬀering “proof of concept” , Parks elaborates a purposive sample of cases of “joy”
found in journalistic and quasi-journalistic work along eight constitutive “pillars ”or guide-
posts —derived
from the Dalai Lama and Archbishop Desmond Tutu ’sThe Book of Joy :
“perspective ”,“humility ”,“humor ”,“acceptance ”,“forgiveness ”,“gratitude ”,“compassion” ,
and “generosity ”. To this, more expansive conceptions are added through open coding,
which Parks sees epitomized in stories of “performative deﬁ ance ”.
Importantly, entailed in the humanistic perspective and related conceptualization of
“joy”Parks proposes, is the belief that journalism scholars as well need to re-think their
own disposition and engagement with news, as “joy can be cognitively apprehended
only in and amongst being felt” . The paper ’s intervention thus stretches beyond
concept explication to a fundamental reconsideration of the epistemologies and method-ologies guiding scholarly analysis of a ﬀect and/in news, a stimulating proposition which
the present analysis does not so much state as actually live in an invigorating way
throughout.
Likewise, this special issue hopes students of news values will feel inspired and enabled
by the multifarious work presented here to explore, re ﬁne and interrogate theorizations
and methodologies in the ﬁeld, and to pursue the avenues for future research suggested
or prompted by the di ﬀerent contributions. As demonstrated throughout, “news values” ,
as one of journalism studies ’foundational analytical frameworks, persists in the contem-
porary media culture and zeitgeist as a rich, vibrant site of debate and analysis, which,importantly, radiates the research ﬁeld’s heterogenous nature. This is evident in the
range of disciplinary traditions feeding the conceptual frameworks and methodologies
assembled here, from communications, literature and linguistics, to philosophy and theol-
ogy, to law studies, political sciences, and psychology. As a result, a variety of methodo-logical approaches, both well-established and state-of-the-art, are exempliﬁ ed and often
brought together in refreshing ways under the umbrella of news values analysis. Examin-
ing news values through features of processes and products, and production and user
practices, methods as diverse as computer-aided content and discursive analysis,JOURNALISM STUDIES 699experimental designs using eye-tracking software or collaborative, participant-generated
research techniques, or a form of auto-ethnography, are applied to various kinds of media,
including newspapers, global television and online sources such as news aggregators andgrassroots newsfeeds. In doing so, this themed issue also engages and traverses the
diﬀerent dimensions along which news values can be understood, considering inter-
actions between them —as in cognitive perceptions and/or routines re ﬂecting, adapting
to or distorting material reality, or discursive choices expressively reinforcing perceived
news values— while also contemplating an additional, “aﬀective ”dimension. What
emerges from this, is a view of news values as a solid and productive research traditionin its own right that is essentially entwined with fundamental debates on current andfuture developments in journalism, with which the contributing authors engage in
both descriptive and normative ways. Above all, as these observations entail elements
of contextual, holistic and comparative sensitivities, normative awareness, considerationsof communicative power, and, ﬁnally, methodological pluralism, they ultimately point out
how the conversation prompted by the central theme of “news values in the digital age ”is
very much aligned with the “core commitments ”of the journalism studies ﬁeld (Carlson
et al. 2018).
