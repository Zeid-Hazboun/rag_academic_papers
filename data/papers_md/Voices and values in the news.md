This paper explores how discourse analysis can be used to investigate the construction of news-
worthiness in news media talk via the establishment of nine news values: Timeliness, Consonance,Negativity, Impact, Proximity, Unexpectedness, Superlativeness, Personalisation and Eliteness. It com-
pares linguistic approaches to news values and discusses cognitive, social, material and discursive aspects
of news values. Focusing on broadcast news, the paper illustrates how discursive news values analysiscan be combined with analysis of attribution strategies. Analyses show how voices are integrated andhow news values are combined and packaged. The paper argues that bringing together news values
analysis and attribution analysis can provide detailed insights into journalistic practice.</p>
<p>/C15news values are “the criteria employed by journalists to mea-
sure and therefore to judge the ‘newsworthiness ’of events ”and
to“select, order and prioritise the collection and production of
news ”(Richardson, 2007 : 91);
/C15news values are “the values by which one ‘fact ’is judged more
newsworthy than another ”(Bell, 1991 : 155);/C15news values are constraints that “have a cognitive representa-
tion ”(van Dijk, 1988 : 121), providing “the cognitive basis for
decisions about selection, attention, understanding, representa-
tion, recall, and the uses of news information in general ”(van
Dijk, 1988 : 119);
/C15“news values are the ( imagined ) preferences of the expected
audience ”(Richardson, 2007 : p. 94, italics in original);
/C15news values are “the qualities that make a news item ‘news-
worthy ’”(Cotter, 2010 : 67).
From these de ﬁnitions, it is apparent that news values are seen
by linguists as playing an important role in the news process:journalists measure and judge the perceived newsworthiness of
events based on what they imagine their audiences ﬁnd news-
worthy and use this judgment to select (include/exclude), orderand produce news stories.

disciplinary review in Caple and Bednarek (2013) .2Note that there is some debate about the extent to which journalists write for
the audience and how informed they are about that audience. For instance, Green
(1999) notes that the conditions in Australian newspaper newsrooms are not
conducive to implementing audience research successfully, and Ewart ’s( 1 9 9 7 )
study of an Australian regional daily newspaper found that journalists have ideasabout “typical ”readers, but “say they did not generally consider readers when
writing stories, but thought more about the editorial hierarchy and its members'reactions ”(Ewart, 1997 : 93). On the other hand, Bell (1991) , a former journalist
turned linguist, provides empirical evidence for what he calls audience design (how
linguistic style is adapted to a news outlet ’s readership), which can also be seen in
the linguistic differences between the ‘popular ’and the ‘quality ’press ( Bednarek
2006a : 203). It is also clear that audience metrics (including information about
most clicked, viewed, liked, shared, etc.) are in ﬂuencing 21st century newsrooms
(e.g. Bell, 2015 ).Discourse, Context and Media 11 (2016) 27 –37However, linguists have included different aspects of the news
process under the heading of news values .A s Table 1 shows, van
Dijk (1988) and Bell (1991) take a broad approach and include a
variety of economic and newsgathering aspects. This contrasts
with Bednarek and Caple (2012a : 41) and Caple and Bednarek
(2013) , who restrict the term news values to Bell's category of
“values in news actors and events ”. They agree with Cotter (2010 :
80) that factors such as space, content mix, deadlines and othersare best treated as “factors other than newsworthiness ”which
impact on news production. The remainder of this paper makes
use of the term news values in this narrow sense.
Like other values, news values can be considered to have cog-
nitive, social and discursive aspects: in van Dijk
0s (1998) words,
values are culturally “shared mental objects of social cognition ”
(74); they are “applied by social members in a large variety of
practices and contexts ”(74), and discursive strategies may estab-
lish (p. 262), select, or emphasise speci ﬁc values (p. 286). While
van Dijk makes these points about values in general, we may also
consider news values to have these three dimensions (cognitive,
social, discursive). In addition, a fourth dimension can be recog-
nised: a ‘material ’dimension.3Each dimension corresponds to a
different research perspective on news values, as suggested inTable 2 .
However, in much news values research, these four dimensions
are not clearly distinguished, and at times con ﬂated. O’Neill and
Harcup (2008) point out that “discussion of news values some-
times blurs distinctions between news selection and news treat-
ment ”(O’Neill and Harcup, 2008 : 171, italics in original).
4Montgomery (2007: 10) notes that “the epistemological status of
the ‘factors ’[news values] is somewhat ambiguous ”.
Following Bednarek and Caple (2012a) , this paper takes a dis-
cursive perspective on news values, albeit with a focus on language
and excluding other semiotic resources. Newsworthiness is thustreated as a quality of news media talk and text, and news valuesare conceptualised as the ‘newsworthy ’aspects of actors and
events as constructed through linguistic resources. Most previous
comments on the relationship between language and news values
(Bednarek, 2006a ;Bell, 1991 ;Cotter, 2010 ) appear to suggest that
news values exist independently of language or prior to the newstext and/or assume a mono-directional process, one where newsvalues ‘drive ’or become ‘embedded ’in language. In contrast,
referring to news values as ‘constructed ’or‘established ’empha-
sises the constitutive dimension of texts in what Fairclough sees asthe dialectical relationship between texts and society/culture,where “[t]exts are socioculturally shaped but they also constitute
society and culture, in ways which may be transformative as well
as reproductive ”(Fairclough, 1995 : 34). It is also in line with the
assumption that cognitive representations are “(re)produced as
well as (re)constructed by social practices ”(van Dijk, 1998 : 228),
including discourse. Using the words ‘construct ’or‘establish ’aims
to emphasise the ‘bottom-up ’aspect of social reproduction, where
social practices sustain, continue and change the system ( van Dijk,
1998 : 229), without denying that there is also a ‘top-down ’aspect
of social reproduction. In sum, this constructivist approach is notintended to be anti-cognitivist, anti-material or anti-ethnographic,but rather presented as complementary to existing approaches.
In theory, a discursive perspective can be applied to the various
phases of the news process: from story conceptualization, storyconstruction, and story position to evaluation of the reporting (seeCotter, 2010 : 73 for these stages). In practice, I have started by
systematising the linguistic resources used to construct news
values in published/broadcast news stories, working with a list ofnine news values, as explained in Section 2 .Table 1
Approaches to news values .
van Dijk (1988 : 120) Bell (199 :1 5 6 –160) Caple and Bednarek (2013)
“News values formulated in the economic terms of news
production ”: e.g. sales/subscriptions, budgets, amount
of advertising, limitations of space, beliefs/opinions ofnews actors and the public, number of reporters,agency subscriptions, competition
“Closely tied to the social routines of newsgathering and
organisational production ”: periodicity/deadlines,
news organisation into sections, accessibility of sour-
ces (elites)Values in the news process: continuity, competition, co-
option, composition, predictability and prefabricationNews selection factors: anyfactor or criterion
impacting on whether or not an event gets covered
or a story becomes published, not necessarily values
Values in news actors and events: negativity, recency,
proximity, consonance, unambiguity, unexpectedness,superlativeness, relevance, personalisation, eliteness,attribution and facticityNews values: values relating to the newsworthiness
of events and actors
Values in the news text: brevity, clarity and colour News writing objectives: general goals associated
with news writing, such as clarity of expression,
brevity, colour, accuracy, etc.
Table 2
Dimensions of news values.
Material: an event in its material reality holds potential news value What are an event 's potential news values?
Cognitive: news workers and audience members have beliefs about news values
and newsworthinessWhat beliefs do news workers and/or audience members hold about news values?
Social: news values are applied as selection criteria in journalistic routines and
practicesHow do news workers apply news values as criteria in selecting what events to cover and
publish?
Discursive: news values can be established/constructed or negotiated through
discourseHow are news values communicated through discourse, pre-, during, and post-news
production and in news products?
3The use of the term material is inspired by John Richardson ( Bednarek and
Caple, 2012b : 103).
4Galtung and Ruge (1965) themselves distinguish three elements: selection
(events that satisfy news factors will be selected); distortion (once selected, the
news media accentuate what makes news items newsworthy), and replication ,
meaning that selection and distortion occurs “at all steps in the chain from event to
reader ”(p. 71).M. Bednarek / Discourse, Context and Media 11 (2016) 27 –37 28Table 3

recent, within a margin of between
one and several days ”(121)Recency: “the best news is something
which has only just happened ”(156)
Consonance: “News should be con-
sonant with socially-shared norms,values, and attitudes ”(121)Consonance: “the compatibility with
preconceptions about the social group ornation from which the news actorscome ”;“People have a mental script for
how certain kinds of events proceed.Environmental issues, demonstrations,or superpower summits are all perceived
to have a typical pattern which they
follow. These events will tend to be seenin terms of the script ”(157)Consonance: “classes of event that trig-
ger a ‘news script ’that strongly deter-
mines the shape of coverage ”(8); “Even
the unexpected event can in its coverageassume familiar contours ”(8)Consonance: The event (including the
people, countries or institutionsinvolved) is (stereo)typical in the view ofthe target audience
Deviance and Negativity: “much news
is about negative events such as
problems, scandals, con ﬂict, crime,
war, or disasters ”(123)Negativity: “the basic news value ”;
“news is bad ”(156) [includes damage,
injury, death, disasters, accidents, con-ﬂict, war reporting, deviance]Negativity: “Bad news makes good
news. ”[e.g. war reporting, crime, acci-
dent, earthquake, famine, epidemics,disaster, execution] (8)Negativity: The event is negative for the
news publication's target audience, forexample an environmental disaster,crime, act of violence, opposition, con-ﬂict, controversy, etc Conﬂict: “Conﬂict between opposing
parties ”[e.g. strikes, divorce, war,
election campaigns] (7)
Relevance: “information is preferred
about events or actions that arerelevant for the reader ”(122)Relevance: “the effect on the audience ’s
own lives or closeness to their experi-ence ”(157)Impact: The event has signi ﬁcant effects
or consequences (including but not lim-ited to direct impact on the news pub-
lication ’s target audience)
Proximity: “local [village, town, coun-
try, continent] and ideological
proximity ”Proximity: “geographical closeness can
enhance news value ”;“related is …the
cultural familiarity and similarity of onecountry with another ”(157)Proximity/Cultural relevance: “The fur-
ther removed an event from the news
centre the less relevance it has for thenews outlet ”[includes geographical dis-
tance and cultural distance] (8-9)Proximity: The event is geographically or
culturally near the news publication's
target audience
Unexpectedness: “the unpredictable or
the rare is more newsworthy than theroutine. Closely related is
NOVELTY [in the
sense of ‘newness ’].”(157)Unexpectedness: “the novel, the atypical
and the unusual ”(8)Unexpectedness: The event is unex-
pected for the news publication's targetaudience
Superlativeness: “the biggest building,
the most violent crime, the mostdestructive ﬁre gets covered ”(157)Scale/Scope: “of a scale large enough to
warrant attention ”(6)Superlativeness: The event is of high
intensity or large scope/scale (in theview of the target audience)
Personalisation: “indicates that some-
thing which can be pictured in personalterms is more newsworthy than a con-cept, a process, the generalised or themass ”(158)Personalisation: “People have news
value in a way that processes do not ”(7);
human reactions create human interest(7)Personalisation: The event has a perso-
nal or ‘human ’face involving non-elite
actors, including eyewitnesses
Eliteness: “reference to elite persons
such as politicians or ﬁlm stars ”;“the
elite nations of the First World arejudged more newsworthy than the non-elite nations of the South ”(158)Power: “involves people with power –
however this may be de ﬁned ”[e.g. pre-
sidents, princesses, prime ministers,popes] (7), and “powerful organisations,
powerful nations and power blocs ofvarious kinds ”(8)Eliteness: The event (including but not
limited to the people, countries or insti-tutions involved) is of high status orfame in the eyes of the news publica-tion's target audience.
Attribution: “the eliteness of a story's
sources ”,“elite on some dimension,
particularly socially validated author-
ity”(158)
Unambiguity: “the more clearcut a story
is, the more it is favoured. ”(157)Meaningfulness/unambiguity:
“material
whose meaning can be presented as ifclear-cut and unambiguous rather thancloudy and complex ”(9)
Facticity: “the degree to which a story
contains the kinds of facts and ﬁgures on
which hard news thrives: locations,
names, sums of money, numbers of allkind ”(158)
Presupposition: “The evaluation of
novelty and recency presupposesextant knowledge and beliefs ….
Presupposed information …may
need partial expression ”(121)M. Bednarek / Discourse, Context and Media 11 (2016) 27 –37 292. De ﬁning speci ﬁc news values
Table 3 compares the nine news values used in this paper with
those that other linguists have recognised, in no particular order.5
T h en i n en e w sv a l u e su s e di nt h i sp a p e ra r eT i m e l i n e s s ,C o n -
sonance, Negativity, Impact, Proximity, Unexpectedness, Super-lativeness, Personalisation and Eliteness, as de ﬁned in Table 3 .T h e
organising principle behind their conceptualisation is Ockham's Razor,which states that we should use no more explanatory concepts than
are absolutely necessary. This means that related concepts are inclu-
ded in one general news value rather than establishing an additionalvalue for each related concept. Thus, van Djik's Novelty (in the sense of‘newness ’) is included in Timeliness, which covers a range of time-
related concepts that are mentioned in news values research,including newness, recency, immediacy, and currency. Similarly,Montgomery's Con ﬂict is included in Negativity, in agreement with
van Dijk and Bell, who list con ﬂict as an example of Negativity rather
than postulating it as a separate news value. This is also the case for
Bell's Attribution, which is included in Eliteness, because it relates tothe eliteness of sources. To give a ﬁnal example, Montgomery's
Intensity/Discontinuity seems to refer both to an ‘intense ’event or ‘a
sudden deviation from the norm ’. The former is covered in Super-
lativeness, while the latter is covered in Unexpectedness. The aim is ageneral framework of the basic underlying values. Sub-categoriescould be established by researchers if required for more delicate
analysis (e.g. Fig. 1 ).
A further difference is that Impact is included, rather than
Relevance. Relevance, as de ﬁned by van Dijk seems rather vague
(‘relevant for the reader ’), while there is overlap with Proximity in
Bell's de ﬁnition, since he includes ‘closeness ’to the audience's
experience. Note also Montgomery's use of the term Proximity/
Cultural relevance . It seems a better solution, then, to avoid the
relatively general term relevance altogether, and to restrict Impact
to effects or consequences, while both geographical and culturalcloseness are included in Proximity –which indeed has the
meaning of ‘closeness ’or‘nearness ’.
Further concepts that are excluded are Facticity, Presupposition
(both listed by only one linguist in Table 3 ) and Unambiguity
(listed by two). While there is no doubt that facticity is importantin the language of news, it is excluded here because of ourfocussed de ﬁnition of news values (cf. Section 1 ). Facticity does not
concern actors or events; rather it concerns the amount of evi-
dence gathered ‘about ’a story, its truthfulness/factual status, or
the credibility of the news organisation, and might thus be con-sidered a ‘meta ’-value ( Bednarek and Caple, 2014 : 152). This canbe gleaned from Bell's (1991 : 158) de ﬁnition: “the degree to which
a story
contains the kinds of facts and ﬁgures on which hard news
thrives: locations, names, sums of money, numbers of all kinds ”
(italics mine). Thus, I would say that a story, rather than a reported
event, is (constructed as) factual and reliable through the use of
numbers, etc. Presupposition and Unambiguity are also not con-
cerned with news values in a narrow de ﬁnition but rather with
presupposed information and news writing objectives.
Finally, the de ﬁnitions aim to take into consideration con-
textual factors such as the time and place of publication and itstarget audience, since all news values are “situationally sensitive ”
(Montgomery, 2007 : 6). For instance, a news story that mentions
New Zealand will construct Proximity in a newspaper published in
Australia with an Australian target audience, but not in a news-
paper published in Germany with a German target audience. A
reference to an event having happened on Sunday will construct
more Timeliness in a news story published on the followingMonday or Tuesday than one published on the following Friday. To
give a ﬁnal example, certain target audiences might perceive
particular happenings as negative, while others would not (e.g.
immigration, carrying a gun, marriage equality, deregulation of
university fees, cycling infrastructure). Other events would prob-
ably be evaluated as negative by many (death, famine, crime).
When considering news values it is thus important to consider thetarget audience, even if this may not always be a uni ﬁed group –
especially when controversial issues are concerned or issues that
are relevant to particular sub-groups. Often, the news text will
give clues how the audience is positioned (for further discussion of
this issue see Bednarek 
events that “go critical ”and “can be
condensed to a narrow event such aseconomic slump, famine or the melting ofan ice-cap ”;“an event which represents a
sudden deviation from the norm ”(6)
Fig. 1. Possible sub-categories for one news value.
5As explained above, news values are approached in this paper as relating to
actors/events. Therefore, other aspects conceptualised by van Dijk, Bell or Mon-
tgomery as ‘news values ’(e.g. composition/ ﬁt) are not discussed here. While
Table 3 focuses on researchers' lists, Cotter (2010: 68) makes the point that what
she calls “in-group taxonomies ”(textbook lists of news values, with the key news
values of Timeliness, Proximity and Prominence) differ to those of “outsiders ”(lists
compiled by researchers).M. Bednarek / Discourse, Context and Media 11 (2016) 27 –37 30time…); explicit time references ( today, yesterday, within days,
now…); implicit time references ( continues, ongoing, have begun
to…), verb tense and aspect ( have been trying, is preparing, is
about to …); references to seasonal or current happenings/
trends.
2.Consonance ([stereo]typical): evaluations of expectedness
(routine for, famed for …); similarity with past ( yet another,
markedly similar to, typical style, once again …); constructions of
stereotypes.
3.Negativity (negative aspects): negative evaluative language
(terrible, dangerous, slaughter …); reference to negative emotion
and attitude ( distraught, worried; condemn, criticise …); negative
lexis ( conﬂict, damage, death, crisis, abuse, controversial, row …),
other references to negative happenings (e.g. the breaching of
socially approved behaviour/norms).
4.Impact (having signi ﬁcant effects or consequences): evaluations
of signi ﬁcance ( momentous, historic, crucial …); reference to real
or hypothetical important or relevant consequences ( note that
will stun the world, Australia could be left with no policy, leaving
scenes of destruction …).
5.Proximity (geographically/culturally near): explicit references
to place or nationality near the target audience ( an Australian;
Australia, Canberra woman …); references to the nation/com-
munity ( the nation ’s capital; home -grown…); inclusive ﬁrst
person plural pronouns ( our nation 's leaders …).
6.Unexpectedness (unexpected aspects): evaluations of unexpect-
edness ( different, astonishing, strange …), comparisons that indicate
unusuality ( theﬁrst time since 1958 ,Sydney 's wettest August in 16
years ); references to surprise ( shock at North Cottesloe quiz night;
people just really can ’t believe it …); references to unusual hap-
penings ( British man survives 15-storey plummet …).
7.Superlativeness (of high intensity or large scope/scale): quan-
tiﬁers ( many, all, thousands …); intensi ﬁers ( sensational, drama-
tically, super, severe, extreme …), including intensi ﬁed lexis ( epi-
demic, smashed, stun, wreck …); references to growth/escalation
(growing, raised …), repetition ( building after building …); some
instances of metaphor/personi ﬁcation/simile ( a tsunami of
crime; epidemic swallowing Sydney, looked like the apocalypse …);
comparison ( biggest counter-terrorism raid, most shocking child
abuse case …).
8.Personalisation (having a personal or ‘human ’face): references
to‘ordinary ’people, their emotions, experiences ( Charissa Ben-
jamin and her Serbian husband; “It was pretty bloody scary ’; But
one of his victims […]sobbed; Deborah …said afterwards: ‘My
sentence has only just begun ’…).
9.Eliteness (of high status or fame): vario us status markers, including
labels, recognised names, evaluations of importance, descriptions of
achievement ( experts at Harvard university ,ah i g h - p r o ﬁle arrest,
Barack Obama, the Oscars, a key federal government minister, top
diplomats, were selling millions of records a year …).
This list should not be taken as an automatic checklist and
analyses must take into account context and use. This means
paying close attention to the meaning potential of the linguistic
resource as it is used in the news story, as well as to the intended
target audience. Further, the list applies to prototypical news
stories (rather than say, business or sports news or letters to the
editor, obituaries, current affairs programs, etc) and additional
resources for broadcast news bulletins may need to be added, as
most previous work was undertaken on print news. For instance, I
have not yet explored sound features such as stress/emphasis,intonation, prosody etc. (but see van Leeuwen, 1984 ,1992 ).
6Two examples will be used to brie ﬂy illustrate how a discursive
news values analysis of published/broadcast news stories might
proceed, using radio news podcasts.7
(1) In an unexpected development nobodies have been found
inside Christchurch 'squake-ravaged cathedral (Radio New
Zealand Morning Report, Midday News for 5 March 2011)
In example 1, the evaluative adjective unexpected and the
negative determiner noestablish the development of events as
contrasting to what one would have expected to happen (Unex-pectedness). In addition, references to Christchurch construct the
happening as geographically close to the New Zealand targetaudience. The use of the present perfect ( have been found ) suggests
that the event has recently been completed (Timeliness) and theintensi ﬁed adjective quake-ravaged encapsulates the negative
impact of the earthquake on the cathedral, simultaneously con-
structing Negativity, Impact and Superlativeness.
(2) Correspondent: Tokyo is a city well-known for its work
ethic
but for another day company owners told some
employees to stay home to conserve electricity.
(NPR 7 A.M. News Summary, 18 March 2011)
In example 2, the use of the timeless present and the reference to
general knowledge ( is well-known for ) refer to received knowledge
around Tokyo in particular and the Japanese in general (the stereo-type of being hard-working). This establishes Consonance, which is,however, immediately countered through use of a contrasting
statement introduced by the conjunction but. This contrast estab-
lishes the news value of Unexpect edness, since the event is in con-
trast to what one would expect the ‘hard-working Japanese ’to do.
T h ea i m so fd i s c u r s i v en e w sv a l u e sa n a l y s i so fn e w ss t o r i e sa r ea t
least two-fold: one, to comprehensively analyse what values areemphasised or de-emphasised in news stories; second to identify
how news values are constructed linguistically (e.g. via recurring
phraseologies, ﬁgurative devices, rhetorical strategies). Examining
how events are endowed with newsworthiness by the news mediashows which aspects of the event are emphasised, and reveals theshape in which events are packaged for news consumption byaudiences. There is also value in showing how news values areconstructed, which aids the identi ﬁcation of common conventions
and clichés of news reporting and provides insight into news aslinguistic practice (Potts et al., 2015 ).
4. News values and attribution
So far, DNVA has not paid much attention to intra-textual
concerns, for instance combining news values analysis with ana-
lysis of attribution strategies, i.e. the use of reported speech andthought.
8This is despite the recognised fact that “[r]eported
speech is …an essential ingredient of news language ”(Leitner,
1986 : 191). This paper aims to somewhat rectify this neglect.
There is a wealth of linguistic studies on attribution in the news,9
whether on print news (e.g. Bednarek, 2006a ,b;Caldas-Coulthard,
6NB: In examples 1 and 5 below, marked emphasis on words is clearly used to
stress the news values of Unexpectedness and Negativity/Superlativeness, which(footnote continued )
are established by grammatical (negation) and lexical (intensi ﬁed negative verb)
resources: no bodies were found; whose hopes were once again dashed .
7For reasons of scope I use only orthographic transcription in this paper and
restrict analysis to lexical and grammatical devices.
8An exception is Chapter 9 in Bednarek and Caple (2012a) , which analyses
only two videos.
9For reasons of scope, I strictly focus on linguistic research on how voices are
represented here, therefore excluding research from Journalism/CommunicationsStudies on interactions between sources and journalists (e.g. Gans, 1979 ) and newsM. Bednarek / Discourse, Context and Media 11 (2016) 27 –37 311994 ;Calsamiglia and López Ferrero, 2003 ;Clark 2010 ,Dahl and
Fløttum, 2014 ;Fairclough, 1988 ;Garretson and Ädel, 2008 ;Geis, 1987 ;
Richardson, 2007 ;White, 2012 )o rb r o a d c a s tn e w s( e . g . Leitner, 1986 ;
Lombardo, 2004 ;Piazza 2009 ;Wortham and Locher, 1996 ), including
identi ﬁcation of the different voices that can be identi ﬁed (e.g. Mon-
tgomery, 2007 :8 7 –88). There is broad agreement that factors such as
the following may be distinguished (not necessarily applying equally
across print/broadcast news; cf. Zelizer, 1989 ):10
1)Whose voice is it ? For instance, in the context of TV war news
Haarman and Lombardo (2009) differentiate between news
presenter, embedded reporter, correspondent, legitimated
(high-status) person, vox populi (ordinary member of public),
and military personnel (ordinary soldier). Both Tolson (2006)
and Montgomery (2007) point out that broadcast news often
features live interviews between the in-studio newsreader and
an af ﬁliated representative (e.g. in- ﬁeld correspondent). User-
generated content is also important ( Lorenzo-Dus and Bryan,
2011 ).
2)Where are voices located and how do we access them ? Are they in
the studio or in the news ﬁeld, seen on camera or heard as
voice-over ( Montgomery, 2007 : 116)? Content attributed to
other voices (e.g. in documents, graphs, emails, tweets) may
also be inserted as a shot within a broadcast news story or
superimposed onto the screen.
3)How are voices identi ﬁed? Montgomery de ﬁnes an identi ﬁeras“a
speci ﬁcation of the grounds on which they [interviewees]
speak ”(Montgomery, 2007 : 151). Identi ﬁers may directly con-
struct newsworthiness, as identi ﬁcation works to establish
sources as authorities (e.g. two senior Labour MPs, authorities,
ofﬁcials)o r ‘ordinary ’members of the public (e.g. mother-of-two,
panel-beater Colin McNamara ), constructing, respectively, Elite-
ness and Personalisation ( Bednarek and Caple, 2012a ,2014 ).
This also works for unnamed sources, with labels claiming
“standing ”(Bell, 1991 : 193; Stenvall, 2008 ) or Eliteness for
them.11
4)How are other voices integrated ? A range of options are available
here, from direct discourse to indirect discourse or unattributeddiscourse ( Fairclough, 1988 ;Leitner, 1986 ;Piazza, 2009 ;Zelizer,
1989 ).
5)What reporting expression is used to introduce content, if any ?I ti s
widely recognised that different reporting expressions encode
meanings ranging from the mere act of saying ( say, tell ) to the
illocutionary force ( promise, threaten ), relation to surrounding
discourse ( reply, add ), institutional context ( rule) or para-
linguistic features ( whisper, scream ) of the utterance (e.g. Bed-
narek, 2006a ; Caldas-Coulthardt, 1994) or according to other
types of meaning, such as degrees of reliability or dis/endorse-
ment (e.g. Calsamiglia and López Ferrero, 2003 ,White, 2012 ).In relation to point 4 above, Leitner (1986) recognises six
options for broadcast news. Bell (1991) mentions ﬁve ranks,
arguing that “[t]here is a hierarchy of talk in news stories which
ranks it according to the degree in which the original verbatiminput is reproduced ”(Bell, 1991 : 205). Fairclough (1988) focuses on
demarcation instead of hierarchy, proposing that in direct dis-course, “the ‘voice ’of the reporter or the newspaper and the ‘voice ’
of the person whose discourse is being represented ”(126) are
clearly demarcated, which is not the case in indirect andunsignalled discourse. Table 4 combines the three approaches,
using the term source for Bell's term newsmaker. Note that Leitner
and Fairclough position free indirect discourse differently, Leitneras close to direct quotation, Fairclough including it under his“unsignalled ”option.
Drawing on the distinctions made in Table 4 , I will now discuss
a range of examples to illustrate how news values and attributionanalysis might be combined. I will also refer to Montgomery'swork on news interviews where relevant. Most examples aretaken from a set of radio podcasts collected between December2010 and April 2011 ( Bednarek and Caple, 2012a : xiii), with some
additional audio –visual examples collected for this paper. Since
my focus is to illustrate the combination of news values analysiswith analysis of attribution strategies, rather than to providequantitative insights, examples were selected that exemplify wellthe different ways of integrating voices described in Table 4 .
4.1. One voice: news presenter
Despite the importance of attributed speech in the news, there
are instances without other ‘voices ’
, where newsworthiness is
constructed solely by the institutional voice. In example 3 (in Table
5), the female news presenter seen at the beginning is the only one
speaking, the only ‘voice ’heard, and no other voices are integrated
via attribution. In combination with the visuals, which I will notanalyse here, her talk (on camera and voiceover) establishesnewsworthiness by constructing Proximity through place refer-ences (e.g. South-East Queensland; Brisbane; The Gold Coast )–the
more so, the closer to South-East Queensland the Australian
audience is located. Her talk also constructs Eliteness through
mentioning the state's emergency services as an authority ( emer-
gency services ), Superlativeness through intensi ﬁcation and quan-
tiﬁcation ( battered; a second round …in as many days; more than
70; more than a hundred kilometres an hour; up to 60 mm; wild ),
(negative) Impact ( battered; calls for help; receiving …rain),
12and
Timeliness ( underlined): Although no time is speci ﬁed, the pre-
sumption is recency, and the event is constructed as ongoingthrough set to continue over the week-end . It is the news presenter
(in combination with the visuals) who establishes newsworthinesshere.
4.2. Multiple voices
According to Montgomery, “in most broadcast news the dis-
course supplied by the institutional voice is supplemented andelaborated by a range of other voices –some, such as correspon-
dents and reporters, af ﬁliated to the institution, some, such as
politicians, bystanders, experts and witnesses, not ”(Montgomery,
2007 :8 7 –88). When multiple voices are combined to construct
the newsworthiness of an event, we can consider the variousaspects of attribution outlined in Table 4 .(footnote continued )
source diversity (e.g. Sigal, 1973 ;Brown et al., 1987 ). This research asks questions
such as ‘how prominently, as well as how often different kinds of sources appear' as
well as ‘how frequently different kinds of sources are cited anonymously ’(Hallin et
al., 1993 : 753, italics in original). Some of these studies focus speci ﬁcally on how
‘ordinary ’people/citizens are represented in the news (e.g. Massey, 1998 ;Lewis et
al., 2005 ).
10Additional options include whether or not aspects of the interactional con-
text, such as references to conversational participants or eliciting questions, arereported ( Clayman, 1990 ;Geis, 1987 ), the use of “second-hand hearsay ”(Geis, 1987 :
86) or “nested speech ”(Garretson and Ädel, 2008 : 178), the use of predicted,
hypothetical or irrealis speech ( Garretson and Ädel, 2008 : 179; Geis, 1987 : 88), and
whether or not the source's utterance is translated or interpreted, which adds an
additional layer of mediation (for example, interpreters speaking with an accent).
11Labels/identi ﬁers also construct news value for other news actors, not just
interviewees and other sources. See e.g. Bednarek (2006a) ,Bell (1991) and Jucker
(1992) .12Where impact is constructed as negative, both Negativity and Impact are
established simultaneously. However, impact need not be clearly negative. Forinstance, receiving a lot of rain is not necessarily negative in a country plagued bydrought.M. Bednarek / Discourse, Context and Media 11 (2016) 27 –37 324.3. Direct discourse/quote: eyewitness
It is a common practice to incorporate ‘ordinary people ’as
eyewitness voices (e.g. Montgomery, 2007 : 159) whose contribu-
tion establishes news value. Example 4 (in Table 6 ) is another
storm video on the Brisbane Times website, which integrates dif-
ferent voices, alongside visuals. Similarly to example 3, the newspresenter's on camera and voiceover talk constructs Proximity(e.g. South-East Queensland ), Superlativeness (e.g. more than 90 km
an hour ), (negative) Impact (e.g. properties damaged )
13and Time-
liness (e.g. over night ), although the event is not constructed as
continuing into the near future and no Eliteness is established. In
contrast to example 3, the news Presenter's talk frames an eye-
witness contribution.14This contribution is not introduced via a
reporting expression and the eyewitness is seen/heard directly (via
on camera/voiceover direct discourse, i.e. rank 1). In her con-
tribution, the eyewitness describes the storm's effects in her ownwords using negative lexis (e.g. damaged/damage ), thereby con-
structing Negativity/Impact. She also uses quanti ﬁcation and
intensi ﬁcation which establish the scope of the happening (e.g. a
lot of, very, very very )–constructing Superlativeness. Additionally,
she emphasises how surprising and unusual the extent of the
damage is for her (e.g. shocking, I just can 't believe )–constructing
Unexpectedness. The use of the present tense establishes her
reaction as immediate (Timeliness). Overall, this eyewitness
account, from an ‘ordinary ’Australian –identi ﬁed via caption
simply as Nicole McPhee, resident –also provides a human face to
the event (Personalisation).
There is no assumption here that the news organisation was
not involved in the eyewitness's contribution: clearly, the source's
talk is elicited, selected and edited by news professionals in the
various stages of the news process. It is clear from the video, forexample, that her ﬁrst utterance is a reply to a reporter's question
and that editing has occurred to splice her utterances together. As
Montgomery notes, it is a common practice in news bulletins toinsert interview fragments, often without reporting clauses, and
that these only make sense “as embedded fragments of larger
interviews conducted by the reporter in preparing the report ”
(Montgomery, 2007 : 177). Table 7 illustrates the resulting packa-
ging of news values in example 4.
4.4. Direct discourse/quote: relatives
‘Ordinary people ’are also integrated in their role as victims, “to
give a viewpoint privileged by some kind of closeness to pro-ceedings ”(Montgomery, 2007 : 156), including quotes from the
relatives of affected news actors, especially when news organisa-
tions do not have access to the latter. Example (5) is an instance ofsuch practice:
(5) Newsreader: And the wait continues for the parents of Aus-
tralian journalist Peter Greste, whose hopes of release on bail
were once again dashed in an Egyptian court over night.
Male voice [presumably Peter Greste ’s father]: I wouldn't want
anybody to even remotely imagine that he's enjoying where
he is now. It is extremely hard and yet er as parents we are just
so so proud to know that he's handling it so well with such
composure and dignity. (ABC, The World Today, 1/4/2014)Table 4

13There is also a reference to the event not having signi ﬁcant impact, at least
in the context of claiming human lives ( Luckily no one was injured ), but this is
presented at the very end of the report, not foregrounded –possibly because it
arguably decreases the newsworthiness of the happening.
14I call her an eyewitness as she is labelled as a resident, having experienced
and lived through the event.M. Bednarek / Discourse, Context and Media 11 (2016) 27 –37 33This extract is about an Australian journalist who was in jail
and on trial in Egypt, beyond direct access to the media. Instead,
we hear from his father, as a surrogate victim. The newsreader in
the studio identi ﬁes him indirectly (metonymically) as father ( the
parents ), which is repeated in the source's contribution ( as parents
we). Such identi ﬁcations establish sources as having “an entitle-
ment to speak based upon a personal and particular connection
with the news material ”(Montgomery, 2007 : 157).
It is unclear where the father is located (presumably at a press
conference) and like in example 4 there is no reporting expres-
sion: we simply hear his voice, with the father's words integrated
as a direct quote (rank 2). The content of the direct quote isinteresting, as it represents both negativity and positivity: the
negativity relates to Peter Greste's negative emotions and the
evaluation of his situation as extremely hard , whereas the positivity
relates to his parents' pride. I would argue that the father's talk
here constructs the news values of Superlativeness and Negativity
with respect to the news event (how hard it is), but also provides a
personal human reaction (Personalisation), framing the event from
the perspective of parental pride (how well Greste is handling it).
In addition, Timeliness is established through the use of simpleand progressive present tense and the adverb now, constructing
the event as ongoing. In his discussion of experiential interviews,
Montgomery argues that they give audiences “a version of what
we might think, see, or feel if we too were close up in some way to
the event ”(Montgomery, 2007 : 159). In discursive news values
analysis I therefore interpret contributions by victims or their
relatives as constructing the news value of Personalisation. Stories
featuring affected individuals can thus be contrasted with more
abstract stories, presenting viewers with statistics about press
freedom, for instance.
The newsreader ’s preceding utterance also constructs Time-
liness ( continues, over night ), Negativity/Superlativeness ( wait
continues ;hopes…were once again dashed ) and Personalisation(reference to Peter Greste's emotions and his parents' experience),
but without including any positivity. In this example, there is aclear demarcation of the voice of the source and the voice of thenews organisation, but at the same time, there is also reinforce-ment, as similar news values are constructed by both voices.
In addition to eyewitness (example 4) and victim (example 5),
there are other roles that ordinary people may inhabit in broadcastnews, without being so directly affected. For example, Mon-tgomery notes that “short on-the-spot interviews amongst
bystanders –vox pops –play an important role in offering a range
of emotional reactions to the event ”(177). Lewis et al. (2005 :7 1 )
see vox pops as a type of citizen participation. From the perspec-tive taken here, such contributions also establish Personalisation,but the discussion will now move to integration of contributionsby journalists.
4.5. Direct discourse/quote: correspondent
In his taxonomy of news interviews, Montgomery (2007 :1 1 7 –143)
describes in detail the live af ﬁliated interview between news pre-
senter and reporter/correspondent, without however integratingnews values analysis. Example 6 is an instance of such an exchangeand will here be discussed primarily in terms of newsworthiness.Table 5

days. The state's emergency services responded to more than 70 calls for help as the system [?] battered parts of Brisbane

correspondent Paul Reynolds is with us. Paul, what happened?
Correspondent (Paul Reynolds): Well, it started at about half
nine last night when about four armed and masked men
entered the home of Liam O ’Sullivan, now Liam O ’Sullivan is a
very senior executive , and I ’m [?positive?] he ’sone of the top
ten executives in the company [ …] (RTÉ Radio 1 News at One,
5 April 2011)
Example 6 is the beginning of an exchange between a news
reader and a correspondent. Because this is an interview, no
reporting expression is used and we hear the correspondent's
words in his own voice (rank 2). His location is not speci ﬁed,
although is with us implies virtual, if not spatial proximity and he
is identi ﬁed as our crime correspondent Paul Reynolds. Because
Reynolds is another journalist rather than a news actor, this label
does notconstruct the news value of Eliteness. However, the label
does imbue him with status and authority via his specialisation,justifying his contribution and adding value to it. It also confers
value on the news organisation as a whole, establishing it as a
trustworthy and authoritative organisation that employs such
‘specialists ’. It is important to make this distinction between
creating value in the news event (constructing it as newsworthy)
and creating value for the news organisation (see Bednarek and
Caple (2015) for further discussion). The status of journalists can
be further boosted by premodi ﬁers, as in: ABC 'schief business
correspondent Rebecca Jarvis .
Without analysing this example in depth, what is interesting in
this exchange between news reader and correspondent is that the
news reader's talk only labels Liam O ’Sullivan a postal worker , but
the correspondent repeatedly emphasises his high status, evalu-
ating and describing him as a very senior executive and one of the
top ten executives in the company . It is the correspondent's con-
tribution that establishes the news value of Eliteness here, con-structing the affected news actor, Liam O ’Sullivan, as a socially
recognised elite professional. Montgomery (2007 : 122) points out
that the language of correspondents is often evaluative, and he
argues their talk is about “doing being interesting ”, by which he
means sounding lively and engaging. However, it is clear from this
example that the talk by correspondents is also about establishing
newsworthiness. This would be in line with Montgomery'sobservation that correspondents who are interviewed in a bulletin
news programme “will be invited to give an assessment (or,
maybe, an explanation) of the signi ﬁcance of the news material ”
(Montgomery 2007 : 199) –if we consider newsworthiness a key
aspect of the signi ﬁcance of the news material.
So far the emphasis was on direct quotes, but I will now brie ﬂy
discuss partial quotes and indirect integration.
4.6. Slipping/partial quote
As noted above, the term slipping orpartial quote refers to
instances that integrate an incomplete direct quote. This is most
easily seen in writing, as in The report said there was a “signiﬁcant
disconnect ”between what consumers expected of their policy and the
reality of what it provided (The Sydney Morning Herald online).15In
contrast, example (7) shows an instance from an Australian radio
programme:(7) Newsreader: The Marshall Islands government criticises Aus-
tralia's approach to climate change, calling it confusing and
disappointing (ABC, The World Today, 1/4/2014)
In Example 7 we are provided with the newsreader's voice and
do not hear the voice of the source directly, but the use of the
reporting expression calling it seems to suggest that the adjectives
confusing and disappointing are quoted verbatim. In other words,
this verbal phrase signals that these are the exact words chosen bythe Marshall Islands Government.
16
At the same time, the voices are not clearly demarcated, as
listeners only aurally experience the voice of the newsreader. Inexample 7, then, the newsreader constructs Eliteness throughidenti ﬁcation of the source ( The Marshall Islands government )a s
well as Proximity for the Australian target audience ( Australia 's),
with Negativity established both through the reporting expressioncriticise and the negative evaluative adjectives ( confusing ,dis-
appointing ) that are integrated via slipping (falling between ranks
3 and 4).
4.7. Indirect discourse/reported speech and thought
As mentioned in Table 4 , the use of indirect discourse (with
reporting clause and shifts of pronouns, deictics, tense, etc.) is,according to Bell (1991) ,“the main method by which all media
handle newsmakers ’speech ”(205). Example (8) provides several
examples of indirect speech in a radio news programme:
(8) Newsreader: The international court in The Hague found that
Japan was not meeting the objectives of its research under
International Whaling Commission rules. Japan has said it's
disappointed by the decision but will abide by it.
But some
legal experts are cautioning environmentalists not to celebrate
too soon, saying the decision could perversely lead to even
more whale deaths. (ABC, The World Today, 1/4/2014)
Focussing only on the underlined sentence in example 8, we
can see how the news organisation makes use of indirect discourse
(rank 4) by sources that are constructed as elite ( legal experts ). The
voices of the news organisation and the experts are not clearlydemarcated here. The reporting expression cautioning and the
reported utterances are used to emphasise the news value ofNegativity, rather than focusing on what many Australian listenersmight see as a positive outcome (the court decision). This is in linewith assumptions that Negativity is “the basic news value ”(Bell,
1991 : 156) and Galtung and Ruge's original claim that “negative
news will be preferred to positive news ”(Galtung and Ruge, 1965 :
69, italics in original). This is not to say that positivity does notoccur in news discourse: van Dijk argues that “[n]egative news
without positive elements of some kind is probably hard to digest ”
(van Dijk, 1988 : 124), providing the example of attention to the
police in crime news and rescue operations in disaster news. Wehave also seen positivity used in the construction of Personalisa-tion (parental pride) in example 5 above. However, it appears that
positivity may often be de-emphasised, especially in hard news
stories.
17We have already seen in example 4 that positivity may
15Esther Han, Private health insurers may be breaking the law by varying
customers' policies: ACCC, http:// www.smh.com.au/business/retail/private-health-
insurers-blasted-for-confusing-customers-by-accc-20151020-gkddrz.html , acces-
sed 20 October 2015.16In print news, the use of calling it is often but not always followed by a word
or phrase in quotation marks. The question is whether or not examples that lackdirect quotes should be classi ﬁed as examples of indirect discourse (because there
are no quotation marks) or as examples of slipping (because of the use of calling it ).
If we assume that it is the use of calling it rather than the use of quotation marks
that indicates a verbatim choice of words, then such instances in broadcast news
should be considered examples of slipping. Leitner's (1986 : 191) example for partial
quotes is what he called .
17Positivity may play a more important role in soft news. Feez et al. (2008 :7 2 )
argue that newsworthiness is in essence about reporting both “destabilising ”M. Bednarek / Discourse, Context and Media 11 (2016) 27 –37 35be backgrounded by placing it at the very end of a news story
(Luckily, no one was injured ). Example 8 shows how potential
positivity ( celebrating ) is nipped in the bud, so to speak, by con-
trasting it with negativity attributed to authoritative (elite)
sources.
4.8. Unattributed/unsignalled
Theﬁnal category to be discussed concerns what Bell (1991)
calls ‘unattributed ’and Fairclough (1988) ‘unsignalled ’discourse
(cf.Table 4 ). Here, source content is not explicitly marked as such,
as seen in example (9):
(9) Correspondent: …According to these newly released docu-
ments from the house panel investigating GM it was a series
of missteps by both GM and regulators that allowed the pro-
blem to go unaddressed for more than a decade. In 2002, GM
approved using the faulty switches even after the outside
vendor provided test results that showed GM the parts that
didn't meet speci ﬁcations. Then in 2005 GM engineers met to
consider making changes to the switches, according to the
reports , but decided against it.
(ABC/US World News with Diane Sawyer, 31/3/2014)
In example 9, the correspondent's underlined utterance is not
explicitly attributed to anyone but listeners know that the infor-
mation comes from the documents/reports that are explicitlymentioned before and after, using the neutral reporting expression
according to . Thus, the utterance is an example of unsignalled
discourse, where audiences might need to work harder to recog-
nise the source of the reported content. In this example, the focus
of the reported content is squarely on the news value of Negativity.
But the identi ﬁcation of the documents used by the correspondent
further constructs Timeliness ( newly released ) and Eliteness ( the
house panel investigating GM ), signalling to the audience that this is
new information provided by an authority. As Lemke (1998 : 52)
proposes, specifying a credible source increases the warrantability
of attributed propositions (a similar argument is made in Fair-
clough, 1988 : 131, and White, 2006 ,2012 ). In a similar vein, van
Leeuwen includes ‘expert authority ’as a legitimation strategy ( van
Leeuwen, 2008 : 107).
5. Concluding remarks
This paper has discussed a range of issues around discursive
news values analysis (DNVA) that have remained relatively unex-
plored so far. In addition to other aspects, I have illustrated how
DNVA may be combined with analysis of attribution, which can
show us both how sources are identi ﬁed and how their talk is
integrated. The latter has consequences for distinguishing clearly
between voices or not and how news values are combined andpackaged. Bringing together news values analysis and attribution
analysis can provide detailed insights into the linguistic practices
of journalism as evident in published texts. As Clayman puts it,“embedding practices constitute fundamental journalistic tools-of-
the-trade, for it is through them that reporters and their audiencesjointly construct the sense and import of reported speech ”(Clay-
man, 1990 : 100). It can tell researchers how news values are
integrated, structured, presented and packaged in the form ofconsumable news products for audiences and how news organi-sation position themselves within discourse. Such analysis enablesus to see whether audiences engage with the voice and authorityof sources or of the news organisation ( Bednarek and Caple,
2012a :2 1 4 ) –whose version of events is presented and how
visible is the news organisation in its reporting?
In this paper I have only focussed on language and have pri-
marily used examples from broadcast news. Clearly, devices otherthan language also play a role in constructing newsworthiness andneed to be taken into account when investigating the packaging ofevents as news ( Caple, 2013b ). Further research is also needed into
the different ways in which newsworthiness is constructed acrossprint, radio, TV, online and mobile news and into how the differ-ent resources and affordances of each medium are exploited toestablish and package events as ‘news ’.

stories of the popular press ( Conboy, 2002 : 174) and ben-Aaron (2003) argues that
stories about national holidays are neutral or positive. Compare also Caple and
Bednarek (2013 : 19) for Journalism scholars who claim that success or positivity
may be a news value. More empirical research is needed into where and how
positivity occurs in different kinds of news stories and news story genres. For
instance, news stories reporting the death of a person would usually not emphasisenegativity, unless the person was controversial or socially classi ﬁed as a criminal or
dictator for instance. Sports news may also exhibit more positive than negativeemotivity ( Caple 2013a : 285).M. Bednarek / Discourse, Context and Media 11 (2016) 27 –37 36Feez, S., Iedema, R., White, P.R.R., 2008. Media Literacy. NSW Adult Migrant Edu-
