he increasing popularity of the framing concept in 
media analysis goes hand in hand with signiﬁcant 
inconsistency in its application. his paper outlines an 
integrated process model of framing  that includes produc-
tion, content, and media use perspectives. A typology of 
generic and issue-speciﬁc frames is proposed based on 
previous studies of media frames. An example is given of 
how generic news frames may be identiﬁed and used to 
understand cross-national diﬀerences in news coverage. 
he paper concludes with an identiﬁcation of contentious 
issues in current framing research. 
Introduction
Millions of citizens turn to the news media daily and ‘the 
media’ is a cornerstone institution in our democracies. 
One inﬂuential way that the media may shape public 
opinion is by framing events and issues in particular 
ways. Framing involves a communication source pre-
senting and deﬁning an issue. he notion of framing has 
gained momentum in the communication disciplines, 
giving guidance to both investigations of media content 
and to studies of the relationship between media and 
public opinion. he term framing is referred to with signiﬁcant inconsistency in the literature. Moreover, 
most previous studies of framing have focused on either<br />
content (e.g., frames in news) or framing eﬀects. his 
article argues that becoming aware of diﬀerent types of 
frames is necessary to understand when and why dif-
ferent frames are at work. he paper deﬁnes framing as 
a process  and it outlines an integrated process model of 
framing that includes production, content, and media 
use perspectives. Based on a review of previous studies 
of media frames a typology of issue-speciﬁc and generic 
frames is proposed. A case study shows how generic<br />
news frames may be identiﬁed and used to understand 
cross-national diﬀerences in news coverage. he study 
is an illustration of how framing can be used as a tool to 
study media content. 
Framing as a process
he potential of the framing concept lies in the fo-
cus on communicative processes . Communication is 
not static, but rather a dynamic process that involves 
frame-building (how frames emerge) and frame-set-
ting (the interplay between media frames and audience 
predispositions). Entman (1993) noted that frames have 
several locations, including the communicator, the text, 
the receiver, and the culture. hese components are 
integral to a process of framing that consists of distinct Claes H. de Vreese
News framing: Theory and typology52 Claes H. de Vreese
stages: frame-building, frame-setting and individual and 
societal level consequences of framing (d’ Angelo, 2002; 
Scheufele, 2000; de Vreese, 2002).
 Frame-building  refers to the factors that inﬂuence the 
structural qualities of news frames. Factors internal  to 
journalism determine how journalists and news organ iza-
tions frame issues (Shoemaker<br />
Tuchman, 1978) and social movements (e.g., Cooper, 
2002; Snow  Shah et al., 2001), 
but few empirical studies have investigated the ‘reversed 
information’ phenomenon. he vast majority of framing 
studies, more or less explicitly, apply a broader  deﬁni-
tion of frames. Conceptually , a broader notion of news 
frames is indebted to a deﬁnition of a frame as ‘a central 
organizing idea or story line that provides meaning to an 
unfolding strip of events, weaving a connection among 
them. he frame suggests what the controversy is about, 
the essence of the issue’ (Gamson  89). 
 When working with a deductive approach, the rel-
evant question is: what  (which components) in a news 
story constitutes a frame? Entman (1993, p. 52) sugg ested 
that frames in the news can be examined and identiﬁe d 
by ‘the presence or absence of certain keywords, sto ck 
phrases, stereotyped images, sources of information  and 
sentences that provide thematically reinforcing clu sters of 
facts or judgments. ’ Along these lines Shah et al. (2002, p. 
367) refer to ‘choices about language, quotations, and rel-
evant information. ’ Gamson and Modigliani (1989) id en-
tify ‘framing devices’ that condense information and  oﬀer 
a ‘media package’ of an issue. hey identify (1) met aphors, 
(2) exemplars, (3) catch-phrases, (4) depictions, a nd (5) 
visual images as framing devices. he most comprehen-
sive empirical approach is oﬀered by Tankard (2001,  p. 
101) who suggests a list of 11 framing mechanism or focal 
points for identifying and measuring news frames:</p>
<ol>
<li>headlines</li>
<li>subheads</li>
<li>photos</li>
<li>photo captions</li>
<li>leads</li>
<li>source selection</li>
<li>quotes selection</li>
<li>pull quotes</li>
<li>logos</li>
<li>statistics and charts, and</li>
<li>concluding statements and paragraphs.In sum, scholars within the empirical approach to</li>
</ol>
<p>measuring frames agree that frames are speciﬁc textual 
and visual elements  or ‘framing devices’ . hese ele-
ments are essentially diﬀerent from the remaining news 
story which may be considered core news facts . Price 
et al. (1997, p. 488) operationalized a frame by varying 
‘introductory and concluding paragraphs to establish a 
unique journalistic frame’ with information exclusive 
to the frame while the other paragraphs in the news 
articles were kept identical. In the same vein, Neuman et 
al. (1992, p. 126) in their content analysis divided news 
articles in to sections containing ‘frames’ and sections 
containing ‘facts’ . he distinction between core elements<br />
and frame-carrying elements  has eﬀectively been applied 
in the operationalization of news frames in most stud-
ies of framing eﬀects (e.g., Cappella<br />
Iyengar, 1991, Price et al., 1997; Valentino et al., 2001; de 
Vreese, 2004).
A typology of news frames
While newsmakers may employ many diﬀerent frames 
in their coverage of an issue, scholars agree that th is 
abundance in choice in how to tell and construct stor ies 
can be captured in analyses as certain distinctive char ac-
teristics. In order to synthesize previous research and the 
diﬀerent types of news frames that have been suggest ed, 
a more general typology or distinction with reference to 
the nature and content of the frame is suggested her e. 
Certain frames are pertinent only to speciﬁc topics or<br />
events. Such frames may be labelled issue-speciﬁc frames . 
Other frames transcend thematic limitations and can be 
identiﬁed in relation to diﬀerent topics, some even ov er 
time and in diﬀerent cultural contexts. hese frames ca n 
be labelled generic frames  (de Vreese, 2002). his typol-
ogy serves to organise past framing research focusin g 
on diﬀerences that help explain the use of the catc h-all 
‘framing’ phrase.55 News framing: Theory and typology
 An issue-speciﬁc approach to the study of news 
frames allows for a profound level of speciﬁcity and 
details relevant to the event or issue under investiga-
tion. his advantage, however, is potentially an inherent 
disadvantage as well. he high degree issue-sensitivity 
make analyses drawing on issue-speciﬁc frames diﬃcult 
to generalize, compare, and use as empirical evidence 
for theory building. he absence of comparability has 
led researchers to ‘too easily ﬁnding evidence for what 
they are looking for’ and to contribute to ‘one of the 
most frustrating tendencies in the study of frames and 
framing [being] the tendency for scholars to generate a 
unique set of frames for every study’ (Hertog  McManus, 1994; Price  Does the story 
refer to two or more side or to more than two sides of the 
problem/ issue?’; ‘Does the story emphasize the achievement s 61 News framing: Theory and typology
and or actions of an individual/ party versus the achievements 
and/ or actions of another individual/ party?’
3. he other items for the economic consequences scale were: 
‘Is there reference to economic consequences of pursuing or 
not pursuing a course of action?’; ‘Is there a mention of ﬁnan-
cial losses or gains now or in the future?’ .
4. he alphas for the conﬂict frame were: Britain = .67, Den-
mark = .74; the Netherlands = .81. For the economic conse-
quences frame the alphas were: Britain = .57; Denmark<br />
= .70; and the Netherlands = .61. With all item-total correla-
tions consistently positive, the reliability was acceptable.
